Thus, a\nqadar could be dealt with through another qadar.\n\nIf something unfortunate happens to us, e.g. if we lost our job, we don't just say that it's\nqadar and do nothing about it. We look for another job, the consequence of which is\nanother qadar.\n'Umar bin al-Khattab was traveling with a group of Sahabahs during his Khilafah (leadership).\nThey were coming to a town when they heard that it had a contagious/infectious disease, i.e.\ncholera. 'Umar asked his group whether they should proceed or go back (to Madinah). The\nmajority of the Sahabahs said they should go back but some said they should proceed. Then one\nSahabi said he knew a hadith where the Prophet, sallallahu 'alayhi wasallam, said, \"If you hear that\nthis disease exists in a country, don't travel to that country.\" So 'Umar decided that they should\ngo back. Another Sahabi (it seems from the second group) asked him whether he was running\naway from a qadar. 'Umar replied that they were moving away from one qadar to another qadar.\nThus, whenever there is a problem, a challenge or any hardship which we can remove,\novercome, solve or minimize, it is a must that we do so. Some scholars like al-Imam al-Jilani use\nthe term: \"overcoming qadar\" in this regard.\nIn one hadith, the Prophet, sallallahu 'alayhi wasallam, said, \"Be keen for whatever is beneficial for\nyou. Seek the help of Allah. And don't be reckless.\" This hadith implies we must make the effort.\nThe right concept of qadar is: we are responsible for whatever we do.\nFor example: If we were to drive recklessly and caused an accident where someone died or was\ninjured, we cannot simply say that it is qadar, abusing the concept to justify our mistakes. It is\nqadar that the incident took place because it is by the permission of Allah. But we are responsible\nfor the death because it is through our willingness and ability that it happened. That's why in the\ncourts we will be found guilty. If qadar can be used as an excuse, then many crimes will go\nunpunished - a thief can simply claim that his stealing was qadar!\nThose who abuse the concept of qadar are those who fail to be responsible. They abuse it to\njustify their failure. The correct way of using qadar as an excuse is: if someone exerts himself to\ndo his best to fulfil an obligation but due to an unavoidable circumstance, which was out of his\ncontrol, he could not achieve that obligation - then he might be excused. For example, a student\nhas studied hard for an exam but on the day of the exam he falls sick and does poorly or cannot\neven attend the exam, then he can say that it is qadar and that it is the will of Allah.\nWhen it comes to religious obligations, the matter is the same. We cannot blame qadar for\ncommitting sins or failing to do a wajib as some Muslims might do. We have to know that we are\nresponsible. We might get into a weak status of Iman in doing a sin or delaying a wajib. Islam is\nsuch a practical religion that it gives us room for repentance and getting back to the right path.",

But the first two definitions can be\ninterchanged with each other - sometimes Islam can be used to describe internal actions and\nIman can mean external actions.

This will lead us to strive\nfor our best in performing our ibadah - we will be more sincere in our ibadah. Thus Al-Ihsan is\nalso about the best actions of the heart.

    "text": "- 17 -\nBackground\nThis hadith is part of the previous Hadith (2). Most Scholars say that the reason why al-Imam alNawawi included this hadith in his collection, even though it seems that it repeats some portions\nof Hadith 2, is because of the importance of the 5 pillars of Islam.\nThis Hadith stresses the fundamental aspects of the outward submission to Allah. This\nsubmission is based on some pillars, similar to a structure. If a person fulfills these aspects, he\nhas laid a solid foundation for his deen as a 'home'.\nThe other acts of Islam, which are not mentioned in this hadith, can be taken as fine touches to\ncomplete this structure.\nIf a person fails to fulfill these obligations (building the pillars), then the entire structure of his\ndeen/iman may be threatened. This depends on how much is being violated - e.g. violation of the\nshahadah is the most dangerous.\nLessons\nThe use of metaphors and similes\nThis hadith uses a metaphor (i.e. the image of the structure of a building) to affirm certain\nimportant meanings. This use of metaphors and similes can be found in many Surahs in the\nQuran and in many other hadiths. For example:\n\nIn Surah At-Taubah (9): ayat 109, a similar metaphor is used - the structure of the\nMua'min's deen/iman is based on a sound foundation, whereas the structure of the deen\nof the Munafiq is based on weak ground which may lead to the collapse of the structure,\nresulting in the Munafik entering the Hellfire.\n\nSurah An-Nur (24): ayat 35, uses the metaphor of light as the light of guidance in the\nheart of the Mua'min.\n\nA metaphor used to condemn those who fail to fulfill the amanah (i.e. religious\nobligations) can be found in Surah Al-Jumu'ah (62): ayat 5. The Bani Israel, having failed\nto obey Allah's commandments in the Taurah, are described as a donkey which is\nburdened with heavy books on its back but doesn't understand anything from them.\nScholars have said that this metaphor also applies to other nations, which fail to fulfill\ntheir amanah.\n\nIn one hadith the Prophet, sallallahu 'alayhi wasallam, divided the status of his ummah into\nthree categories: those who benefit from the Message, those who benefit partially and\nthose who fail to benefit at all. He, sallallahu 'alayhi wasallam, used the metaphor of rain (as\nthe Message) falling down on different types of land, producing different results.",

The Scholars say \"iqamatus\nsalah\" implies:\n\nDoing the wudu in the proper way\n\nTo do the salah in its time\n\nTo do it in congregation (jama'ah) - where the reward is 27 times than praying alone\n\nTo fulfill the six conditions of salah\n\nTo observe the proper manners (adab) of doing it such as submission and humility\n\nTo follow preferable actions (sunnan) in our salah\nIt is important that we follow these conditions and not violate them if we want to truly fulfill the\nsecond pillar of Islam i.e. \"iqamatus salah\". We should remember that Allah initially commanded\nus to pray fifty times a day and it was eventually reduced to five times (with the reward of fifty) -\nthe prayer times are very reasonably spread out throughout the day - it can even help us to\nmanage our time - it can help us to manage our affairs, allowing the Muslim community to meet\nduring congregation and care for and help each other which will lead in turn to solidarity. Thus,\nthe prayers should not be seen as a burden as some Muslims might regard them today.\nThird Pillar: Zakat\nThe giving of Zakat has been pointed out by the Prophet, sallallahu 'alayhi wasallam, for certain\nthings and in certain ways or percentages and under certain conditions. The Scholars say that\nknowing the details of Zakat only becomes an obligation when a person owns the type of\nproperty or thing which requires him to give Zakat for. E.g. Farmers or traders or property\nowners need to know the conditions and percentages of Zakat that they are obligated to give.",

The conflicts are as follows:\n1. The addition of the word \"nutfah\" (the drop of a fluid)\nThis word is not mentioned in Bukhari neither Muslim's narration. However it was\nadded to other narrations including the one chosen by al-Imam al-Nawawi to provide a\nbetter interpretation or explanation but instead it gave two conflicting views of the\ncreation of mankind in terms of stages of the fetus:\nFirst\nView:\nThe three stages of the fetus consist of forty days each, equaling to a total of 120 days for\nthe stages to complete. It is only after this 120 days that the ruh (spirit) is breathed into\nthe fetus, as well as the recording of the fetus' provision life span, deeds and destiny.\nThis view, the inclusion of the word \"nuftah\", is the view held by the majority of the\nScholars.\nOne problem with this view is that the stages of the fetus as interpreted in this hadith\ncontradict the facts proven by science today.\nAnother problem concerns the Fatwa on abortion. Scholars say that abortion is allowed\n(provided there is a very good reason - e.g. the woman's life is in danger) only before the\nruh is breathed into the fetus, i.e. before 120 days - as opposed to 40 days if the second\nview is to be taken (see below).\nSecond\nView:\nThe word \"nutfah\" does not belong to the text of the hadith. This changes the meaning of\nthe hadith which interprets the three stages of the fetus as taking place in the first forty\ndays. This view correlates with scientific facts. And this means that the ruh is breathed\ninto the fetus after forty days, and not 120 days. Consequently the Fatwa on abortion\nstates that abortion is allowed only before forty days.",

    "text": "- 25 -\nHe will be good to us. We should be optimistic and not pessimistic. We follow Allah's\ncommands and make the effort to be good Muslims and we should not despair.\nDuring one of the battles, a companion (Sahabi) said to the Prophet, sallallahu 'alayhi wasallam,\nthat he was following him, sallallahu 'alayhi wasallam, to fight in the hope that an arrow will be\nshot through his (the Sahabi's) neck, coming in from the front and going out the back. The\nProphet, sallallahu 'alayhi wasallam, said, \"If you are honest with Allah, Allah will be honest with\nyou.\" The Sahabi died exactly as he hoped to.\nThe Prophet's, sallallahu 'alayhi wasallam, words here are generic and can be used for all situations.\nIf we are honest with Allah, Allah will not leave us - He will help us - He will guide us, etc. The\ncloser we are to Allah, the more He will help us and guide us. Thus, the last section of this hadith\nis an exception and applies only to few people such as the Munafiqin.\nBut this, on the other hand, does not mean that we live in hope alone. The Scholars say that we\nmust combine hope with fear - when we worship Allah, we should have hope as well as fear of\nHim. Fearing Allah is a positive thing. The more we fear Allah, the closer we get to Him. The\nmore we fear Allah, the more calm and at peace we will be. This is unlike the natural 'fear' where\nif we fear something, e.g. a fire or a dangerous animal, we will try to get away from it.\nScholars say that we should have an equal amount of hope to the amount of fear. This is so we\nwill have a better status of Iman (faith) - there is no despair and at the same time there is no\nexcessive hope (over-confidence) which could lead to laziness and the non-fulfillment of our\nobligations. This is why we need to combine hope and fear, as well as love Allah the most and\nhave trust in Him.\nThis above hadith is about Allah's Creation and Qadar. The statement: \"that which has been\nwritten will overtake him\" should be understood in the positive sense and not negatively. Allah\nwith His ultimate knowledge knows what will happen as it has been explained in the previous\nhadith.\nAl-Qadar can be categorized as:\n1. Al-Qadar al-Kulli - the general qadar which has been recorded by Allah in AlLauhulmahfudz or the Preserved Tablet.\n2. Al-Qadar al-Sanawi - the annual qadar which takes place once a year (Lailatul qadar) -\nwhere it matchs what has been written in Al-Lauhulmahfudz.\nWhat has been written in Al-Lauhulmahfudz is only known to Allah. It is not revealed to us - we\ndon't know about our destiny, what our rizq is, where we'll end up, etc. To us it is ghaib and\nunknown. The translation of this hadith using the word \"overtake\" may not give the true\nmeaning if it were to be understood that whatever has been recorded by the angels will be",

E.g. if we are good Muslims Satan will try to make us delay performing the\nprayer or giving the sadaqah by making it appear as a bad thing to do because\ngiving sadaqah will result in a financial burden for us. As we can see, both cases\nare done through coloring our perception.\nWe can see that some of the components of the human being help us while some are challenges.\nFor example, the Fitrah and Aql are strong components which direct us to do good. However\nthere is a limit to our intellect and for this Allah sent us the Messengers with the revelations to\nguide us. Allah's Guidance helps us by telling us what is good and what is bad, in what forms the\ninsinuation of Satan can come in, etc. When we recite the Qur'an with contemplation, we will\nattain the insight (basirah) which will activate the blaming-self and the nafs ul mutma' inah.\nThe Qur'an tells us that we have been created to be tested: (Allah) Who has created death and\nlife that He may test you which of you is best in deed. [Surah Al-Mulk (67): ayat 2]\nAllah tells us what we are being tested on and the scenarios mentioned above describe the\nnature of the test.

The power and willingness is neutral but it can be influenced/directed\nto go either way, good or bad. If we have the insight (basirah), if we recite the Quran, if we are\nclose to Allah, if we have the wisdom (hikmah), then what will be activated is the sound mind\nand the shahawat (selfdesires) will be controlled and we will not be misled by them. Satan will not\ncome close to us because he knows that if he does so he will not be able to influence us.

Imam Nawawi said it should be\nmemorised by every Muslim.\nThis hadith is used as a criterion for judging external actions or performance of Ibadah. If an\naction is not done in accordance with the Shariah or the Sunnah of the Prophet, sallallahu 'alayhi\nwasallam, it will be rejected and not accepted by Allah based on text of this hadith. This hadith\ncomplements Hadith 1, which was a criterion for judging the intentions or the internal actions of\nthe heart. The Scholars say that the acceptance of actions of Ibadah is based on the above two\nconditions:\ni.\nThe intention - the action should be done with sincerity, for the sake of only Allah.\nii.\nIt should be done in accordance with the Sunnah of the Prophet, sallallahu 'alayhi\nwasallam.\nApart from Hadith 1 and Hadith 5, the acceptance of actions can also be found in Surah AlKahf (18): ayat 110:\nWhoever looks forward to meeting his Sustainer (on Day of Judgement), let him\ndo righteous deeds, and let him not ascribe unto anyone or anything a share in\nthe worship due to his Sustainer.\nEmulating and following the Prophet, sallallahu 'alayhi wasallam, is a Qur'anic obligation. Allah,\nthe Almighty says:\nVerily, in the apostle of God you have the best example to emulate for everyone\nwho looks forward (with hope and awe) to Allah and the Last Day, and\nremembers Allah unceasingly. [Surah Al-Ahzab (33): ayat 21].\nSay (O Prophet): \"If you love Allah, follow me, (and) Allah will love you and\nforgive you your sins.\nLessons\nThis hadith is related to a very important concept which is following the Sunnah and violating\nthis concept will lead to bida'ah [which will be discussed in detail, insha Allah, in Hadith 28].\nScholars classify actions of the Prophet, sallallahu 'alayhi wasallam, into actions done for the\npurpose of Ibadah (worshiping Allah) and actions which are not done for that purpose (i.e.\ncustoms, actions done haphazardly, etc.). There are clear indicators for actions done for the",

For example, some of the nawafil are things which he, sallallahu 'alayhi wasallam,\nwould do from time to time. We should observe this. E.g. Certain Surahs being recited on\ncertain days - it is narrated that the Prophet, sallallahu 'alayhi wasallam, would sometimes recite\nSurah As-Sajdah (32) and Surah Al-Insan (76) on Fridays. But some Muslims would recite these\ntwo Surahs every Friday. We should be aware of this because if we do something regularly\npeople will think that it is wajib even though it is not. If the Prophet, sallallahu 'alayhi wasallam, did\nsomething only from time to time, then we too should do it from time to time, especially when\nwe do it in congregation.\nAs it has been mentioned above, the actions of the Prophet, sallallahu 'alayhi wasallam, were done\nfor different purposes.

The following are some examples:\n\nAt the time of the Prophet, sallallahu 'alayhi wasallam, the men used to have long hair - it\nwas not done for the purpose of ibadah. So if anyone wants to keep long hair today, it\nshould not be done for ibadah.\n\nThe Prophet, sallallahu 'alayhi wasallam, used to open the top buttons of his shirt - this was\nbecause it was hot and not because for the purpose of ibadah.\n\nThe turban, at the time of the Prophet, sallallahu 'alayhi wasallam, was worn because it was\nthe custom then.\n\nSome hadiths mention the Prophet, sallallahu 'alayhi wasallam, using a stick. Again this was\nnot done for the purpose of ibadah.\nWe should not follow these examples of the Prophet, sallallahu 'alayhi wasallam, for the purpose\nof ibadah. How do we differentiate between the actions of the Prophet, sallallahu 'alayhi wasallam,\nwhich were done for the purpose of ibadah and those which were not? The Scholars say if the\nProphet, sallallahu 'alayhi wasallam, commanded us to do an action or commanded us not to do\nsomething, then this is considered an ibadah. Or if the Prophet, sallallahu 'alayhi wasallam,\nmentioned that the doer will receive certain rewards if an action is done, then it is an ibadah.

    "text": "- 37 -\nBackground\nThe first thing to note is that Imam al-Bukhari recorded this hadith in the beginning of the Book\nof Trading (Kitab al-Buyu'), i.e. the kitab started off with this hadith. Some scholars say that\nImam al-Bukhari was not only a muhadith who memorized, collected, recorded and compiled the\nhadith, but he was also a faqih (jurist) and his fiqh (jurisprudence) can be noted in so many ways.\nOne is the tabwib, or the way that he gave the title for each chapter of his book. He would\nchoose a certain statement which he would then use for the title of the chapter. This title reflects\nhis fiqh. Also the way the hadith is recorded, where it is placed, under which chapter, and the fact\nthat sometimes a hadith is repeated in many chapters - all these reflect the fiqh of Imam alBukhari.\nBut why did Imam al-Bukhari start Kitab al-Buyu' with this hadith? What does this imply?\nThere are many implications. One of them is that these doubtful matters are related to the things\nthat we buy and sell, that we trade in. It is also said that his father once mentioned to him that\nfor forty years he never brought anything doubtful into their home.\nIt can be observed that Imam al-Bukhari was influenced by his father's attitude in two ways:\ni.\nHis father brought only halal things into the house. Whatever the family ate, drank, wore\nor used was halal. There were no doubts. This is the environment Imam al-Bukhari was\nbrought and raised up in. It is also said that whenever his father made du'a to Allah\nsubhanallahu ta'ala, Allah answered his du'a because of the fact that he never dealt with\nanything which was doubtful. This is reflected in the behaviour and attitude of Imam alBukhari. Hence like in this hadith where he chose to record it at the beginning of the\nchapter Kitab al-Buyu'.\nii.\nImam al-Bukhari is also known as a great muhadith. One of the things that a muhadith is\ninvolved in is al-Jarh wat-Ta`dil, the status of narrators of hadith - whether they can be\ntaken\nas saadiq, the one who is truthful and trustworthy, or as those who lie and cannot be\ntaken as true narrators of hadith. The muhadithun uses specific terms to indicate the status\nof a narrator. When it comes to the status of the liars, or those who cannot be relied on,\nImam al-Bukhari used a very astonishing style of al-Jarh wat-Ta`dil. He would not use\ndirect terms - rather, he would use indirect ones. This also reflects his piety and\nrighteousness. He would not simply label a narrator a liar. Instead he would say: \"He has\nbeen labelled a liar\".\nAnother matter which is related to Imam al-Bukhari is that whenever there was controversial\nissues or the clashing of views, he would follow the cautious approach. For example, whenever\nthere was conflicting opinions whether something is an obligation or not, such as the recitation\nof Al-Fatihah in prayers, he would be in favour of the view that treats it as an obligation.\nAnother school of thought has a different approach where some scholars follow whatever the\nevidence leads them to - provided it is sound and authentic.",

Only a minority number of acts fall into the\nthird category, that which is doubtful.\nIt can be noted here that the Prophet, sallallahu 'alayhi wasallam, is using a metaphor, or analogy,\ntwice in this hadith. As mentioned before, using metaphors or analogies in communicating ideas\nis very effective and powerful. From the metaphor and the way it is worded (\"just as a shepherd\nwho pastures his flock round a preserve will soon pasture them in it\"), we can say that the\ndoubtful things are closer to the unlawful things.\nThis hadith emphasizes the importance of glorifying Allah subhanallahu ta'ala. If we want to\nglorify Allah, we have to glorify His injunctions, commandments, whether they are obligations\n(so we perform them), or whether they are prohibitions (so we don't perform them). A Salaf\nonce narrated: \"Don't look at how minor the sin is that you committed, but look at the glory of\nthe One you disobeyed, i.e. Allah subhanallahu ta'ala.\" A sin, even if it is a minor one, means\ndisobedience to Allah, hence defying the Glorification of Allah. And the glorification of Allah is\nactually one of the principles of Tawhid.\nWe mentioned before that the great actions or the principles of Tawhid are done by the heart.\nThat is why the heart is mentioned at the end of this hadith. Looking at the hadith at first glance,\nwe might have asked what the heart has to do with the rest of the hadith. It is in the heart that we\nglorify Allah. It is the action of heart when we refrain from the unlawful. If the heart is strong,\nsound, has no weaknesses, and is full of iman (faith), then this would lead us to refrain ourselves\nfrom muharramat and makruhah (undesirable acts). Therfore only those with a strong and sound\nheart, i.e. the heart that is full of love for Allah, fear of Allah and glorification of Allah, will\nrefrain from the doubtful matters. But those whose hearts are diseased and whose iman is weak,\nmay go around the doubtful matters. Little by little they will indulge in the makruhah, delaying\nthings and eventually getting into the muharram or delaying or even negating the wajib. It has to\ndo with the status of the heart. That is why the scholars talk about the life of the heart. For\nexample, when you see Muslims praying in the masjid (mosque), you see hundreds of people\npraying together. But what distinguishes them is the status of their hearts, whether it is devoted\nto Allah or not. How strong and pure is the heart? How sound is the heart? That's where people\ndiffer. This is what we should concern ourselves with, and compete - taking care of our hearts,\npurifying them, taking away any diseases from our hearts, to activate iman in the heart in order to\nmake it alive.",

    "text": "- 39 -\nThe Prophet, sallallahu 'alayhi wasallam, mentioned about Abu Bakr as-Sidiq where he said that If\nyou put the iman of all the Muslim ummah on one scale and the iman of Abu Bakr as-Sidiq on the\nother scale, the iman of Abu Bakr as-Sidiq would outweigh the iman of the whole ummah. The\nProphet, sallallahu 'alayhi wasallam, also said that there is something in the heart of Abu Bakr asSidiq that distinguished it from others, and as it is known he was called as-Sidiq. The Prophet,\nsallallahu 'alayhi wasallam, once said about Abu Bakr: \"When I call someone to Islam, he will have\nsome hesitation...except Abu Bakr as-Sidiq. The minute I talked to him about Islam, straight\naway he believed in me, he believed in Allah and that I am the Messenger of Allah.\" So it has to\ndo with the heart that distinguished Abu Bakr as-Sidiq to be al-Khalifatul-Awal, and to be the\nfirst Sahabi (Companion). From this, it can be said that every Muslim should care about his/her\nheart, purify it and activate iman in the heart, and practise the great principles of Tawhid, such as\nto love Allah, to fear Him, to rely on Him, to have hope in Him, to seek help fro Him and to\nseek refuge in Him so that the heart is alive, activated and full of iman. And at the same time we\nhave to make sure that there should be no diseases or anything bad within our hearts, e.g.\ngreediness, envy, arrogance, etc. Only then will the heart be sound.\nIn another related hadith the Prophet, sallallahu 'alayhi wasallam, mentioned that: \"The heart will\nbe exposed to fitan (trials) again and again. The heart which is influenced by fitnah will have a\nblack spot placed on it. And if the heart avoids the fitnah, there will be a white spot on it.\" The\nheart then is either a pure one, or a heart that has been sealed after being affected by fitan or\nprohibited or doubtful matters again and again. Even though the heart pumps out blood and the\nperson is alive, the heart in reality is not alive, because the iman is weak, making the heart\nunsound. Hence avoiding and getting away from the fitan is important in order to have a pure\nheart, especially in these contemporary times where it is full of evil that attracts the heart.\nThe evil doers promote evil and impose it on others. So if a Muslim is not careful, his/her heart\nmight be stolen. As mentioned by the great contemporary scholar, Sheikh Abdur Rahman adDusari, there are many thieves today who steal the hearts, sometimes without the owner even\nbeing aware of it.\nIf you read any hadith of the Prophet, sallallahu 'alayhi wasallam, it talks about a matter, whether it\nis something good that we should do, or something bad that we should not do. And then in the\nhadith the Prophet, sallallahu 'alayhi wasallam, will mention a principle. Usually, the principle,\nwhich is the main point of the hadith, is the last words or sentence. The hadith above mentions\nabout the lawful and unlawful being evident, and then there is the doubtful matter. And then\nthere is the last sentence of the hadith. This is the bottom-line of the hadith, the main thing, the\nmain issue. If we want to get away from the muharramat (unlawful), and also from the doubtful\nmatters, we have to care about our heart. We have to purify our heart and make sure it is sound\nand alive, and it is not lost from us.",

However,\nwhen we call people to the Sunnah - as advised by Imam Ahmad - we should do it in a\nnice and proper way and not to end up fighting about it. One problem today is that many\nMuslims are unaware of the Sunnah and the status of the Sunnah - so one of the things\nwe should do is to make these people love the Sunnah, and we should not do so in an\naggressive or confrontational way as this might lead to the people being confused,\noffensive and rejecting the Sunnah.\nThere are so many bid'ah being practiced today and the way to remove bid'ah amongst the\npeople is to revive the Sunnah (The Salaf said: \"Bid'ah only arises when the Sunnan is\nnot known or practiced.\"). To revive the Sunnah, we should not start with the\ncondemnation of bid'ah but rather with the introduction/presentation of the Sunnah. We\nhave to set good role models of those who love, and follow the Sunnah and we should\nteach others in a nice, proper way so that others too can understand, love and appreciate\nthe Sunnah. Then they will use the Sunnah as a scale to judge things. Slowly, insha Allah,\nbid'ah will be reduced and minimized.",

    "text": "- 56 -\nBackground\nSabab al-wurud (reasons and background of a hadith) is very important to enable us to\nunderstand its meaning. This hadith can be understood by knowing its background. It was related\nduring an incident where the Prophet, sallallahu 'alayhi wasallam, said: \"Allah has commanded you\nto perform Hajj. So perform Hajj, O servants of Allah.\" Then a man stood up and said: \"O\nProphet of Allah, do we have to do it every year?\" Then the Prophet, sallallahu 'alayhi wasallam,\nsaid: \"That whatever I forbid you to do, avoid it and whatever I command you to do, do it as\nmuch as you can.\"\nLessons\nThe incident above was at the time of revelation. Asking too many questions about an obligation\nmay lead to complications and confusions. The Prophet, sallallahu ‘alayhi wasallam, was not happy\nwith the question raised by the man for it could have caused the Hajj to be performed every year\nby each Muslim if the answer was yes to that question.\nHowever, asking questions in the right way is encouraged as understood from the first hadith in\nthis Forty Hadith collection. In fact, the Prophet, sallallahu ‘alayhi wasallam, used questions and\nanswers to educate his Companions. Questions that lead to knowledge and goodness are\nencouraged. What is prohibited and discouraged are questions that will lead to confusion, doubt\nand chaos in the community, like asking questions about unnecessary details.\nOne significant characteristic of Shariah, i.e. Islamic Law, is its flexibility and practicality. One’s\ncapacity is regarded and considered in fulfilling obligations.\nA Muslim is encouraged to do good actions based on his/her ability and capacity.\nHence Hajj is performed when one has the ability and facility to do it. However if one is tied-up\nwith loans or with other clashing obligations, then there is room for delaying it for another time.\nThis is supported by the Qur’anic verse: “…And Hajj to the House (Kaabah) is a duty that\nmankind owes to Allah, those can afford the expenses…” [Surah Al-Imran (3): ayat 97].\nIn other actions like prayers, the Prophet’s, sallallahu ‘alayhi wasallam, statement “perform as\nmuch as you can” can also mean to perform it at the preferred time and mode (in congregation).\nHowever due to unavoidable circumstances, they can be performed later within the specified\ntime. Similarly, a person who is not able to stand in prayer may pray while sitting.\nFlexibility is also attributed to other obligations like fasting. For example, one may break the fast\nwhile traveling or if he is sick and make it up on other days.",

Literally it means something good. Ibn Rajab\ninterpreted the word as \"at-tahir\", or pure.\nThe term \"Verily Allah the Exalted is pure\" means Allah has all the attributes of perfection and\ncompleteness, free from any kind of shortcomings, weaknesses or needs.\nAs for \"He does not accept but that which is pure\", the hadith refers to all good deeds. Allah\ndoes not accept any deeds that are spoilt by any aspects that may ruin it. For example, the deed\nmust be free from showing-off to others and in the case that involves wealth then the wealth\nmust come from legal sources.\nAllah commanded the Believers (Mu'minin) in the same manner as He commanded the\nMessengers:\n\"O Messengers! Eat of the Tayyibat\" [Surah Al-Mu'minun (23): ayat 51]\n\"O you who believe! Eat of the Tayyibat that We have provided you with, ..\" [Surah Al-Baqarah\n(2): ayat 172]\nLessons\nThe verses above and this hadith imply the following beneficial and useful rulings:\n\nThe money that the Muslims earn must be pure and legal.\n\nThe food that is consumed must be lawful (halal).\n\nThe money with which a person buys food must be lawful, coming from lawful sources.\n\nThese are the keys for acceptance of our deeds by Allah.\n\nWhether something is permissible or prohibited is by the will of Allah. He explains,\nguides and tells us what are permissible and what are not. It is mentioned in the Qur’an\nthat some people have wrongfully made something unlawful when actually Allah has\nmade it lawful, and vice versa. It is actually Allah’s right to make things lawful and\nunlawful.\n\nEarning and consuming lawful things are important conditions for acceptance of our\nsupplications (du’a) by Allah.\nAdab (manners) of du’a mentioned by this hadith:\n\nEarning and consuming lawful things.",

Du’a is an important form of worship (ibadah) that must be eagerly practised by\nthe Muslims. It is a high form of ibadah as it shows our need of Allah in helping us. We\nare in need of Allah’s mercy more than we need the air for breathing. We need His help,\nguidance and mercy in every second and our every single movement.\nIf these adab are not observed, then our du’a may not be responded by Allah. If we want Allah to\nrespond to our du’a, then we need to respond to his commandments such as eating only that\nwhich are lawful to us.\nAnother ruling from the hadith is that charity (sadaqah) is only accepted by Allah if it is from\nlawful sources. This is based on “Allah is pure and only accepts what is pure”. Wealth that is\nobtained from unlawful sources should not be given as sadaqah or used in performing any form\nof worship like performing the Haj. An example is when a person steals money and uses it to\nperform the Haj. In this context, Ibn Abbas said: “Filth does not expiate filth”.\nAnother ruling given by the scholars is that if somebody stole money, then it must be returned\nand not be given away as charity. This is particularly applicable in the case of a person wanting\nto repent (taubah) after stealing the money. The person needs to return the money to the owner.\nIf this is not possible, like if the owner is not known or cannot be found, then according to\nsome scholars it can be used for public benefit like roads.\nAn explanation of the hadith given by Jamaluddin Zarabozo is that this hadith alludes to the\nimportance of supporting oneself through permissible means. How one supports oneself is how\none lives. If it is through legal means, then it will be blessed by Allah.\nAnother explanation given by the scholars is about the issue of ‘public belongings’, like the\nproperty of a company, organization or an institution. This is an important issue and must be\nobserved because public belongings that are wrongfully taken are considered ghalul (a kind of\nstealing or taking something illegally), a practice which are is expiated even by Jihad in the way\nof Allah until one pays them back.

    "text": "- 61 -\nToday, many Muslims take this issue of ghalul for granted. For example, taking paper and pen\nfrom the office for personal use. Another example is the personal use of the photocopy\nmachine, company car, telephone, company money or any other instrument without getting the\npermission from the authority. We will also be held responsible if we damage or vandalise public\nproperty/belongings.\nA good example of protecting oneself from ghalul is one set by Khalifah Umar bin Abdulaziz\nwhen he used one candle for his administration duties and put it out upon completion of his\nduties. He would then use his personal candle.\nWe need to learn from this example of how we should use things in the way they are allocated\nfor. For example, we need to turn off the lights and the air-conditioner when we leave the office\nand save the electricity bill of the company/organization. By doing this, we will be rewarded by\nAllah and Allah will respond to our du’a.\nWe need to create awareness among the Muslims to be more responsible and not to indulge in\nghalul.\nA contemporary issue related to this hadith is about caring what we eat, in terms of two things:\n\nTo be aware of the ingredients of the food in the restaurant or packed/canned foods,\nespecially if they are imported. We need to ensure that they are lawful.\n\nMany of the things that people eat may cause health problems. We need to be more\naware about the healthy aspects of the food, that they are ‘pure’.

In this hadith the Prophet, sallallahu ‘alayhi wasallam, has set\na criterion by which Muslims can decide whether something is permissible or not. There is\nanother version of this hadith where the Prophet, sallallahu ‘alayhi wasallam, elaborated further by\nsaying: “Verily, truth is tranquillity and falsehood is doubt.” This means that the truth will lead\nto tranquillity and falsehood will lead to doubt.\nThus the criterion set by the Prophet, sallallahu ‘alayhi wasallam, allows us to judge what is false or\nwrong (i.e. something which causes us to be doubtful) and what is the truth (i.e. something\nwhich we are sure of and confident that it is correct because we feel happy and at peace with it).\nThis hadith lays down a principle that can be applied in all aspects of one’s life. It also shows the\nway to truth and righteousness. Thus, this hadith is of extreme importance.\nLessons\nThis hadith indicates that one should only perform an act or deed (which is permissible and\nproper) if he is positive or certain of it. Performing this act will lead to some kind of tranquillity\nor happiness in this life and in the Hereafter – this is one of the benefits of applying the hadith.\nIn the other version of this hadith mentioned above, falsehood leads to doubt and never to\ntranquillity. So if a believer finds his heart being disturbed by something (i.e. he feels uncertain\nor doubtful), then he should stay away from it. The heart of the true believer is tranquil at the\nsight of truth and righteousness. And the heart becomes unsure and shaky at the sight of\nfalsehood and wrong.\nWe can conclude that this criterion applies only to the guided righteous Muslim who is\nenlightened by wahi, i.e. the Qur’an and Sunnah, and is adhering to this guidance. If a Muslim is\nindulging in forbidden acts, this criterion will not work for him because his heart will not be\nsensitive to what it faces.\nThe criterion of the hadith is activated by certain conditions or pre-requisites: knowledge, iman,\nadhering to the enlightenment of the wahi, etc. In other words, this criterion can only exist if the\nperson is adhering to the commands of Allah subhana wa ta’ala, the commands of the Prophet,\nsallallahu ‘alayhi wasallam, following the wahi, etc. Only then can a person reach such a status or\nlevel. But for those who indulge in muharramat (prohibitions), do not observe wajibat\n(obligations) , etc., this criterion will not be activated. Even if it does exist, it will not be reliable.\nSometimes there are people who try to avoid doubtful matters while they are indulging in\nmuharram.

After having killed him, they start discussing about the ruling on the killing of\nmosquitoes, whether it is permissible or not.\nThere are many matters or issues relating to the shariah where the scholars have conflicting views\nor opinions. For example, some scholars say that it is a wajib to recite Surat al-Fatihah in the\ncongregational prayer while other scholars say it is not. Or the paying of zakat for Muslim\nwomen’s jewellery – whether a woman has to pay zakat for jewellery that she wears/uses and\nnot just for those that she keeps for investment – an issue which has never been resolved. In\nthese situations, can the Muslim apply the criterion of this hadith? According to some scholars, it\nis permissible to do so – this is known as the ‘cautious approach’. This became a very wellknown approach for some scholars who used it whenever there were conflicting views.\nSo for the issue of reciting Surat al-Fatihah, to those who insist that without reciting it the prayer\nis invalid, these scholars following the cautious approach say that they should recite it. And in\nthe case of the zakat for jewellery, the cautious approach is that it is better to pay the zakat for\nall jewellery, whether it is worn/used or not, so that the woman will be ‘saved’ either way.\nThere is another approach of the scholars which holds that it is not a matter of conflicting\nviews, it is a matter of the authenticity and soundness of the proofs. If there is a sound dalil\n(evidence), the scholars will follow it. This approach is also practiced by those who strictly\nfollow a madhab because the madhab follows a dalil.\nThere are also many situations which consist of both good and bad. The cautious approach will\nsuggest that we avoid an act if it involves both good and bad aspects. The approach which\nfollows the dalil applies the concept of weighing between benefits and harms. This involves\napplying principles derived from the Qur’an and Hadith. These principles state that it is\npermissible to give up a minor benefit in order to avoid a major harm. Or tolerate a minor harm\nin order to avoid a major one or to gain a major benefit.\nLooking back on Islamic history, we can see that some scholars were for one approach while\nother scholars were for the other.

They are of\nno benefit to this life nor to the hereafter, in terms of belief, speech or actions. In justifying this\npoint, the Maliki jurist Imam Ibn Al-Arabi said that a person is not able to take care of all the\nnecessary matters, why would he then get involved in the unnecessary matters that are of no real\nconcern.\nJamaluddin Zarabozo, one of the contemporary commentators of Imam Nawawi's Forty\nHadith, emphasises that Islam protects society as a whole from any kind of harm. Much of the\nharm inflicted on the society are due to people indulging in the unnecessary matters like\nmeddling into the affairs of others when one has no right or responsibility over the particular\nissue. These types of practices normally lead to great evil in the society. The Prophet, sallallahu\n'alayhi wasallam, recommended a way to avoid societal problems.\nHe also commented that a believer should train him/herself to concentrate to be involved in the\nbeneficial matters so that this in itself will be the person's attitude. Do not waste time, money\nand effort in things that are of no benefit in this life and the hereafter.\nPutting the hadith in a different way, part of the perfection of faith (iman) of a believer is to be\nconcerned with matters that are beneficial in this life and the hereafter. This is emphasised by\nanother hadith:\n\"Be keen with what is beneficial to you, and seek help from Allah - do not be reckless.\"\n[Tirmidhi]\nMuslims have enough matters of concern to the extent one may not have enough time to deal\nwith all of them. This is related to the issue of time management, whereby we need to be\ninvolved with matters that are of concern to us.\nAn important question related to this hadith is what are the things to be of concern to a true\nbeliever? Answering this question will enable us to practice this hadith in the right manner.\n\nOne of the things that are of concern is to fulfill the obligations (wajib), to perform as\nmuch as we can of the recommended or preferable acts (mandub), to avoid the forbidden\n(haram) and to avoid as much as we can of the makruh (those that are disliked).\n\nFard-a'yn, an individual obligation, are matters of concern to every one of us. Examples\nare matters like worship and supplication.",

Pride is disdaining the truth (out of self-conceit) and contempt for\nthe\npeople.\"\n[Sahih Muslim: Book 001, Number 0164]\nTherefore we need to be humble and show mercy to others. Part of loving goodness for others\nis to practice mutual consultation, enjoining goodness and forbidding evil. The advice is to be\ndone in a good way, based on loving them and not for seeking personal interest. The Prophet,\nsallallahu 'alayhi wasallam, also used to show his love of others when giving advice to them. It may\nalso be good to explicitly tell the listeners that the reason we are advising them is because we\nlove them and we care for them. If an advice is specific for a person, then it should be done in\nprivate to avoid offending the person.\nFudhayl ibn Iyad went one step higher in putting this hadith into practice. He mentioned that we\nshould not only wish others to be like us but also to wish them to be better than us. However,\nhe said that this is not obligatory (wajib).\nIbn Rajab said that we should wish other Muslims to be better than us in worshipping (ibadah)\nand manners (akhlaq), but at the same time we should wish for ourselves to be better than what\nwe are now. It is not good enough to just wish for something good for other Muslims but at the\nsame time we are deficient and not striving to be better Muslims ourselves. It is from the\ngoodness that we have attained that we also love for other Muslims to have. It is not fair to\nthem that we wish for them to attain the same deficiency that we have in ourselves. Therefore, it\nis a matter of continuous competition among us to attain the goodness.\nA related contemporary issue is about the brotherhood in Islam.

Islam also\nmade it clear that the taking of a human life is the responsibility of the highest authority, i.e. the\njudge. This is to prevent this practice from being abused for personal interests.\nIslam has established rules and regulations for the community that minimise the need to carry\nout the execution of a man or woman as allowed by the three cases defined in the hadith.

    "text": "- 83 -\nSometimes we may encounter a situation which involves fitnah or al-fitan. We have to be careful\nof what we say. There are people who will take advantage of the situation and they may say\nthings which may worsen the situation. When there is fitnah, people are in a panic and might\nbelieve anything. That's why we have to be careful of what we say because it may add to the\npeople's fears and problems. What we should do is to help by saying positive things that will\ngive the people hope; to uplift them and motivate them to face the problems; and not to make it\nworse.\nThe second part of this hadith stresses on being courteous and generous to our neighbours and\nguests. This is stated in the Qur'an - Surah An-Nisa'(4): ayat 36: \"…do good to parents, relatives,\norphans, the poor, the neighbour who is near of kin, the neighbour who is a stranger, the\ncompanion by your side, the wayfarer (you meet), and those (slaves) whom your right hand\npossess.\"\nIn one hadith, the Prophet, sallallahu 'alayhi wasallam, said: \"Jibril kept advising me concerning the\nneighbour to the point that I thought that he would inherit from his neighbour.\" [Al-Bukhari\nand Muslim]. In another hadith [also recorded by Al-Bukhari and Muslim], it is stated: \"Whoever\nbelieves in Allah and the Last Day should not harm his neighbour.\"\nAnother hadith records the Prophet, sallallahu 'alayhi wasallam, as saying that the person who does\nnot have complete faith (iman) is the one from whose affairs the neighbour is not safe. AlBukhari and Muslim also records another hadith which states that when you cook stew, you\nshould add a little bit more water and give some to your neighbours. This sharing of food\nbetween neighbours can strengthen the relationships between them. We should be nice to our\nneighbours and share our food even if they are not Muslims.\nWe should be patient with our neighbour even if he causes annoyance to us. In a hadith, the\nProphet, sallallahu 'alayhi wasallam, said that there are three types of people whom Allah loves.\nOne of them is a person who has a neighbour who causes him harm or annoyance but he\nremains patient and tolerates the neighbour.\nThe 'guest' mentioned in the last part of the hadith is generally interpreted as a travelling visitor\nwho has come to stay for a short while. One hadith states: \"Whoever believes in Allah and the\nLast Day should be generous to his guest. His special gift (to the guest) is one day and night. He\n(the guest) is to be entertained for three days. Whatever is beyond that is an act of charity. It is\nnot lawful for a guest to stay with his host to the extent that he makes things difficult for him\n(the host).\" [Al-Bukhari]. Thus, the visitor should not take advantage of a generous host.\nRegarding this ruling, the majority of the scholars are of the opinion that hosting, in general, is\nrecommended (mustahab) and not obligatory (wajib), even though it is a great and noble act.",

A\nstrong person is the person who contains himself when he is angry.\" [Al-Bukhari;\nBook 47, No. 47.3.12]\nAnd from the du'a (supplications) of the Prophet, sallallahu ‘alayhi wasallam:\n\"I ask you O Allah, for truthful speech during times of pleasure and anger\"\n[Nasaai and Ahmad]\nLessons\nThere are four views, of which two of them are from the earlier scholars and the other two are\nfrom the contemporary scholars, about the interpretation of the Prophet's, sallallahu ‘alayhi\nwasallam, statement \"Do not get angry\":\n1. A person should learn how to change his character and adapt the characteristics of\ngenerosity, kindness, calmness, modesty, patience and forgiving. If a person adapts these\nqualities, then he may be able to restrain himself when he is about to get angry.\n2. One should not act based on anger or while being angry.\n3. When a person is about to get angry, he should control himself, be patient and not get\nangry. This is a contemporary view from Sheikh Al-Bitar.\n4. Ustaz Jamaluddin Zarabozo says that the text can be interpreted in the following way: a\nMuslim must think before acting or speaking. As soon as the feeling of anger appears to\noneself, then there is a need to think of why the anger appears and whether it is\nnecessary to be angry. While asking these questions, the person must remember Allah\nand the Hereafter (Akhirah). This will cause the person to calm down and not get angry.\nAll these interpretations can be applied as different strategies in handling anger in different\nsituations.\nIf a person gets angry, then it is necessary that the person performs a muhasabah, which is to\naccount oneself of the mistakes committed, what leads to them and how to overcome them in\nthe future. This is an important training for us to improve ourselves.\nIn various hadiths, the Prophet, sallallahu ‘alayhi wasallam, teaches us how to control our anger.\nFor example:",

In another hadith the Prophet, sallallahu 'alayhi wasallam, said: “Whoever\nshows mercy even when slaughtering a bird, Allah will have mercy on him on the Day of\nJudgement.” [Recorded by Al-Bukhari]\nIn another hadith, the Prophet, sallallahu 'alayhi wasallam, related this story: “While a man was\ntraveling, he felt very thirsty. He found a well and went down to have a drink. When he came\nout he found a thirsty dog. He said to himself, \"This dog is as thirsty as I was.\" He then went\nback inside the well and used his shoe to bring out some water for the dog. Allah was pleased\nwith him and forgave his sins because of he had done.\" [Recorded by Al-Bukhari]\nIn other hadiths the Prophet, sallallahu 'alayhi wasallam, warns us not to frighten animals. While\nhe was with his companions he found a bird making a greaving sound. The Prophet, sallallahu\n'alayhi wasallam, immediately said: “Who has frightened this bird by taking its offspring?” Then\nhe commanded: “Return back her offspring.” In another hadith the Prophet, sallallahu 'alayhi\nwasallam, warned Muslims not to harm animals. He said: “A lady was put into the hellfire\nbecause of a cat. She tied up the cat and did not give her anything to eat nor did she allow it to\nlook for food.”\nOne more ruling concerning dealing nicely with animals is not to abuse the animals we use for\nachieving certain work (i.e. carrying things) and not to overburden them. In one hadith (which\nshows a prophetic miracle), the Prophet, sallallahu 'alayhi wasallam, was passing by a farm in\nMaddinah when he came across a camel. The camel approached the Prophet, sallallahu 'alayhi\nwasallam, as if it was telling him something. The Prophet, sallallahu 'alayhi wasallam, asked about\nthe owner of of the camel and called upon him and told him, “Your camel is complaining that\nyou overburden him with work, and gives him too little to eat.” [Narrated by Abu Daud, AlHakim, Imam Ahmad, and others and it is an authentic hadith]\nShaykh Abdullah bin Jibrin, a contemporary scholar, is in the view that animals should not be\nused as a testing instrument in the lab (like what is being done in the West) based on a basic\nruling derived from this Hadith 17, where it is prohibited to harm an animal. The testing is only\nallowed if it can be ensured that the animal will not be harmed. All this shows that Islam is the\nreligion of Ihsan and mercy, which is totally contrary to the image of Islam being promoted in\nthe West. Not only that, but this evidently proves that the West are the ones who abuse and\nharm animals.\nEven in Jihad (fighting enemies), Muslims are to apply Ihsan. We are not allowed to kill the\nelders, children, women, and those who are not fighting. When killing the aggressive enemy who\ndeserves to be killed, Ihsan has to be applied and observed. We have to make sure not to cause\nany harm or suffering to anyone we kill. The captives have to be treated with Ihsan as well. It is\nIslam who introduced a new way of dealing with captives. We are to free them on the basis of\nthem teaching some Muslims something beneficial.",

And die not except while you\nare Muslims\" [Surah Al-Imran (3): ayat 102]\nBy realization of Taqwa a Muslim is granted many bounties and blessings which he/she may\ngain. Among them are: the Love of Allah, a criterion by which to judge and distinguish between\nright and wrong, a way out of difficulties, matters will be made easier for him/her, sins will be\nremitted, guidance, help to acquire beneficial knowledge, prosperity and success.\nLessons\nAccording to Ibn Rajab's view as well as other scholars, Taqwa is to fulfill obligations and avoid\nprohibitions and doubtful matters. It is the advice of Allah to all humankind, and it is the advice\nof all prophets, alayhim al-salam, to their people. Prophet Mohammad, sallallahu 'alayhi wasallam,\nused to advise and continuously remind his Companions about Taqwa in all his talks and on\ndifferent occasions.\nThose who define Taqwa as “fearing Allah” look at the concept as a motive, because according\nto early scholars the minimum level of fearing Allah is what motivates a Muslim to fulfill\nobligations and keeps him/her away from prohibitions.\nTaqwa does not imply perfection. Those who have Taqwa are subject to commit sins. However,\nif they do so, they repent right away and follow up the bad deed they have done with a good\ndeed to wipe the bad one out as mentioned in this hadith. This clarifies the debatable issue\nbetween some scholars: whether or not avoiding minor sins is considered an aspect of Taqwa.\nAllah the Almighty and all Merciful has left the door of forgiveness opened to many means by\nwhich the punishment for a sin might be removed. To do good deeds right after bad ones to\nwipe them out is one mean. This is mentioned in Surah Hud, ayat 114: \"Verily, the good deeds\nremove the evil deeds.\"\nThere are other ways and means by which sins are forgiven as stated in the Qur’an and Sunnah\nsuch as:\n\nIstighfar (seeking forgiveness by supplication)\n\nTubah (repentance)",

The Prophet, sallallahu ‘alayhi wasallam, replied that\nwhatever happens is according to what has already been recorded. The man then asked why he\nshould do anything at all. The Prophet, sallallahu ‘alayhi wasallam, made a command [not just to\nthe man but to the whole Muslim ummah] to do good deeds – everyone will be guided towards\nwhat he has been created for.\nAl-qadar can be broadly broken down into two categories:\n1. There are actions that take place which we do not have any control over. We have to\nsurrender to the will of Allah and be patient.\n2. There are actions that take place which we had control over. These events happen as a\nresult of our recklessness, laziness, of not being alert, etc. Even though the minute these\nthings happen they already become qadar, those who are responsible for the actions will\nbe held responsible. Thus, whatever we do, we should do it carefully, completely and to\nthe best of our abilities. For example, construction workers building a site, doctors taking\ncare of patients, driving, etc.\nGenerally speaking, we are responsible for what we do, whether it is in worldly matters or\nwhether it is in our ibadah. We should always strive to improve ourselves and to constantly tell\nourselves that we can do better.\nAlso, we should avoid things that can be avoided, e.g. avoiding disasters, avoiding trouble, etc.\nEven in health, we should avoid consuming things which are unhealthy for our bodies – e.g.\nfood which can cause heart diseases (i.e. contains high cholesterol), etc. In other words, we\nshould avoid things that are bad for us, and not just let it happen and then blame it on qadar.\nIt doesn’t contradict with qadar if someone is sick that he seeks treatment. If we are faced with a\nproblem, we should try our best to solve it or minimise it and not do things which will worsen\nthe situation.\nMany Muslims tend to interpret this hadith (on qadar) negatively. We should understand qadar in\na positive sense. We should differentiate between things which we don’t have control over and\nthings which we do. Instead of just accepting things that happen as qadar, we should see how we\ncan improve the situation and how we can avoid things which can be avoided. We should accept\nthe fact that we are responsible for whatever we do and the choices we make.",

Imam\nIbnu Rajab pointed out two interpretations of the text according to early scholars:\nFirst interpretation: If you have no modesty, then do whatever you wish and Allah will punish\nyou for what you do.\nThis mode of expression is well known in the Arabic language, and it is used for threatening\nsomeone. This mode is used by the Qur'an in Surah Fussilat: ayat 40.\nSecond interpretation: If you are contemplating an act and it is an act such that there is no\nreason to be ashamed of doing it before Allah or the people, then you may do that act.\nModesty is used as a criterion over whether or not to do a certain act. The command here is in\nthe form of displaying permission.\nHowever, there is a valid third interpretation given by Ibnu al-Qayyam who is a scholar from\nthe eighth Hijrah century. He is in the view that the command is not what is meant by this\nstatement. Instead, it is a statement of fact. The meaning is: If a person does not have any\nmodesty, then there is nothing to prevent him/her from doing anything.\nHaya' is one of the most important factors that keeps a person from committing a sinful act. If a\nperson has no haya', he/she will do almost anything.\nLessons\nThere are two aspects of haya' : Natural haya' and acquired haya'. The later is attained as a result\nof knowing and realizing the Glory of Allah and His attributes.\nThere are many manifestations of haya' as mentioned by Ustaz Jamaludin Zarabozo in his\ncommentaries on the Forty Hadith:\n\nHaving haya' towards Allah - a Muslim should feel ashamed to have Allah see him doing\n- or hear him saying - something that displeases Allah, especially when that Muslim is\nalone and out of the view of humankind.\n\nHaya' towards the angels - as they are noble and dignified creatures who witness the acts\nperformed by humans.\n\nHaya' towards other humans - an essential characteristic that keeps people from harming\none another and from performing indecent acts.",

It is derived from the stem \"Qiyyam\", which implies the continuity of doing\nsomething, following up with it and making sure that it is done in the right way and there is\nneither deviation nor swerving.\nThe term has been used by the Qur'an in many verses. Allah the Almighty says:\n\"Therefore, stand firm (on the straight path) as you are commanded and those who turn in\nrepentance with you. And do not transgress, for He (Allah) sees well all that you do.\"\n[Surah Hud (11): ayat 112]\nIbnu Abbas said that this verse was the hardest and most difficult verse of the Qur'an on the\nProphet, sallallahu 'alayhi wasallam.\nIndeed it is a difficult task to achieve Istiqamah, hence, the Prophet, sallallahu 'alayhi wasallam,\nsaid; \"Be straight on the path or be close to it.\"\nIn another verse, Allah the Almighty says:",

To be humble towards Allah, realizing that no one is perfect except Him, seeking His\nforgiveness, guidance and support.\nIt should be emphasized that these steps/conditions apply to worldly matters as well as ibadah\nand good religious deeds.\nFactors that lead to the weakening of Istiqamah include:\n1. Committing sins (ma'siah), insisting on repeating them again and again, without istighfar\n(seeking Allah's forgiveness) and without practicing repentance.\n2. Shirk (associating anything with Allah) whether in intentions, by showing off our good\ndeeds to others, seeking others' appraisal, avoiding being blamed by others, being afraid\nof someone, or to seek rewards from others than Allah. This part of shirk is also called\nriyya' or showing off. All these lead to deviation in Istiqamah, and when these stimuli are\nnot there, the person's work is not perfect any more and it is not done in the best way\npossible.\n3. Nifaq (hypocrisy). There are two forms of nifaq: in belief and in action. The Muslim who\nsurrenders totally to the will of Allah and accept Islam based on his/her choice is free\nfrom the first form of hypocrisy. However any Muslim is subject to and should avoid the\nsecond form of nifaq which the Prophet, sallallahu 'alayhi wasallam, warned us about: Not\nkeeping promises and breaking them continuously without good reasons or excuses, not\nfulfilling commitments we make with others, being aggressive and unjust to others in\nquarrels, and disputes, failing to shoulder responsibilities/burdens we are entrusted with,\netc. All these bad qualities should be avoided since they lead to the weakening of our\nIstiqamah.",

According to some scholars, the person who asked the\nquestion passed away (in the Battle of Uhud) before hajj was made an obligation. As for zakah, it\nis possible that it also was not yet made an obligation; alternatively, the person questioning was\nnot a person of wealth and therefore was not required to pay zakah.\nLessons\nThis hadith indicates that the one who fulfils the obligations and avoids the prohibitions will\nenter Paradise. This meaning has been emphasised in a number of other hadiths.\nThis hadith emphasises surrendering to the Will of Allah subhana wa ta'ala - to accept as\npermissible what Allah has permitted and to accept as forbidden what Allah has prohibited. This\nalso emphasises Islam itself because Islam means to ‘fully surrender to the Will of Allah and to\naccept\neverything\nthat\nhas\nbeen\ncommanded\nby\nAllah'.\nIn our contemporary times, there arise the issue of Muslims not fully adhering to the shariah, i.e.\nAllah's commandments. If this is because they are new Muslims or that they live in areas where\nthere is a lack of knowledge or poor dissemination of information (e.g. there are no scholars to\nadvise them), then this lack of adherence is excusable. However, if a Muslim chooses to\nintentionally ignore or reject the obligations and prohibitions set by Allah without good reasons,\nthen he may be in danger of losing his Islamic entity or identity.\nThese obligatory acts mentioned in the hadith that will lead a person to Paradise require strong\nbelief in Allah, commitment and continuous efforts. Only then will it be an easy task to achieve.\nThis hadith implies that the mustahab (or sunnah or preferable deeds) are not necessary for one to\nbe able to enter Paradise. What counts or what matters is fulfilling the obligatory acts. However,\nwe are encouraged to perform preferable deeds according to our capacity and whenever\npossible.\nThe significance of performing preferable acts is that it will lead us in getting closer to Allah\nsubhana wa ta’ala. In addition, preferable deeds compensate for our shortcomings in performing\nthe obligatory acts.",

This gives insights to educators (murabbi) and preachers (du’at) to observe the\nfollowing lessons when dealing with new converts to Islam:\n1. The murabbi or scholar should take into account the background or status of the\nquestioner before attending to and answering his or her questions. Different people with\ndifferent backgrounds may require different answers or different approaches in\nconveying the answers. This is because a person who comes from a different culture or\nlives in a different environment from the murabbis or scholars may not fully understand\nthe scholar’s explanations if it cannot be related to his/her situation.\nIf the murabbi or scholar doesn’t know the background of the questioner (e.g. if\nquestions are being asked through mail, through the telephone, on the radio, etc.),\nthen he needs to find out as much as possible about the questioner before\nanswering. Some scholars try to speculate what could be the status of the person\nasking the question by, for example, trying to read between the lines of the text of\nthe question. The end-result is that the scholars do not provide one fixed answer\n- there will be a few answers, each applicable to a different situation.\n2. The murabbi or scholar should not overburden new Muslims by asking them or\nencouraging them to perform preferable acts. The murabbi should just get them to start\nwith the obligatory acts. If they are given too much to do, it may become too much for\nthem to cope and they may lose interest in Islam altogether. The murabbi or scholar\nshould start slowly and when the new Muslims are settled and are performing the\nobligatory deeds, only then should they be introduced to the preferable acts.\nSimilarly, new Muslims should not be subjected to conflicting issues or views in\nIslam. For example, they should not be told about the four different schools of\nthought (madhab) and be asked to choose which madhab to follow. This will only\nconfuse the new Muslims. The murabbi or du’at should make it easy and simple for\nconverts to start their new lives in Islam. Only later on can such issues be\ndiscussed.\nThe same thing can be said about the awam (general public). Scholars should not\noverburden them or bombard them with too many obligations or concepts. This\nis also a lesson we can learn from this hadith: the murabbi or scholar should\nobserve the background of the questioner as well as the audience in general if\nthere is no questioner.\nAn area related to this issue is the question of Islamic websites on the Internet. A\nwebsite can be accessed by people from all over the whole world - people from\ndifferent backgrounds and cultures. We have to be careful about the information\nthat we put on these websites. Unfortunately there are Islamic websites that\ncontain controversial issues and conflicting views, where different Muslim groups\nor sects promote only their school of thoughts and criticise other groups.

He says that some scholars have interpreted al-tuhur as to mean 'avoiding\nsins'. But Ibn Rajab disagrees with this and points out that there is another version of the hadith\nwhich says that wudu' or ablution is a 'half of iman'. So he is in favour of this meaning. That is,\nthe term al-tuhur refers to the ritual purification by water (wudu'). He also says that this is the\nview of the majority of the scholars and only a few scholars have interpreted al-tuhur as to mean\n'avoiding\nsins'.\nIbn Rajab actually mentions two reasons why the term al-tuhur is interpreted as wudu' :\n1. As mentioned earlier that it has been stated in another version of the hadith to mean\nwudu' or purification.\n2. Imam Muslim and some other scholars have recorded this hadith in chapters related to\nablution or wudu'.\nThe term shatr or \"half\" (as mentioned in the sentence: \"Purification is half of iman\") also had\ndifferent interpretations among the scholars. Ibn Rajab says that there are several views that\nexplain the meaning of the term shatr.\n1. Some scholars said that shatr means \"part\" and not \"half\". Ibn Rajab says this is a weak\ninterpretation because linguistically al-shatr means \"half\" and not just \"part\". Secondly,\nthe hadith itself has clearly stated wudu' (ablution) as being half of iman (faith) and not part\nof iman.\n2. A second view from other scholars states that al-tuhur means the reward of ablution will\nbe multiplied to the half of the reward of iman. But Ibn Rajab says this view is also not of\na sound interpretation.\n3. The third view takes the meaning as being: iman nullifies all major sins while wudu'\nnullifies minor sins. So in this regard, wudu' is equal to half of iman.\n4. The forth view is that al-tuhur means iman along with wudu' eliminate and nullify sins. So\naccording to this view wudu' is half of iman - but again Ibn Rajab also considers this as a\nweak interpretation.\n5. The fifth view is that the meaning of iman in the hadith is salah (prayer) as mentioned in\nthe Qur'an, in Surah al-Baqarah, Ayah 143. In this ayah Allah called salah 'iman' and the\nsalah will not be accepted unless there is a wudu'. So that is why ablution can be\nconsidered as half of salah. Ibn Rajab did not comment on this view but he disagrees\nwith all the other views mentioned above.\n6. In a sixth view, Imam Ibn Rajab implicitly mentions his own opinion. He favours it from\nall other views because in the earlier interpretations he merely quoted views of other",

Hence, there are two divisions of iman; the first division\npurifies the heart and the internal body and the second division purifies and cleans the\nexternal body. So in this regard, both divisions are two equal parts of iman.\"\nThis is the explanation of the first statement of the hadith which is \"Purification (al-Tahur) is a\nhalf of iman\".\nThe hadith mentions that the phrase al-Hamdulillah fills the mizan (scales) and Subhanallah and alHamdulillah each fills (or both together fill) the space between the heavens and earth. The hadith\nshows the importance, greatness and significance of dhikr Allah or remembrance of Allah\nsubhana wa ta'ala. For example, merely reciting one phrase such as Subhanallah gives rewards that\nfill the heavens! It shows just how important these phrases are for every Muslim.\nAl-Haithamy, one of the great Muslim scholars, stated that the full reward of reciting dhikr will\nbe given to the person who recites them while thinking of their meaning and submitting to their\nimplication.\nThe hadith actually indicates the greatness of these phrases: al-Hamdulillah, Subhanallah wa alHamdulillah. The phrase Subhanallah can be recited alone or together with al-Hamdulillah as stated\nin the text of this hadith. This shows the worthiness of what is called al-Tasbih, glorifying Allah\nand al-Tahmid, praising and thanking Allah.\nIbn Rajab stated that al-Tahmid is greater than al-Tasbih. It means that to be grateful and thankful\nto Allah is better than being in a state of Tasbih or glorifying Him and denying imperfection\ntowards Him. The phrase 'al-Hamdulillah' shows gratitude and thankfulness to Allah. It is a\npositive concept while al-Tasbih is to deny any negative traits towards Almighty Allah and so alTahmid is better than al-Tasbih. Also, al-Hamdulillah is not just thankfulness to Allah. It involves\nmore general aspects because it can be expressed both in words and actions. For example, when\nyou do good deeds, it means al-Hamdulillah, just as when you say good words.\nIbn Rajab says that in the hadith al-Tasbih actually came with the al-Tahmid - it is usually\nmentioned with al-Tahmid. But al-Tahmid can be stated alone without al-Tasbih as found in the\nhadith and other hadiths, as well as in many verses of the Qur'an. So although each term has its\nown significance, al-Hamdulillah is better and more important than Subhanallah.\nThe hadith shows us the worthiness and importance of dhikr Allah in general. It is very important\nand useful and every Muslim should remember Allah all the time. In the Qur'an, dhikr Allah is\nthe only thing that Allah has commanded us to do frequently.",

It means that to be grateful and thankful\nto Allah is better than being in a state of Tasbih or glorifying Him and denying imperfection\ntowards Him. The phrase 'al-Hamdulillah' shows gratitude and thankfulness to Allah. It is a\npositive concept while al-Tasbih is to deny any negative traits towards Almighty Allah and so alTahmid is better than al-Tasbih. Also, al-Hamdulillah is not just thankfulness to Allah. It involves\nmore general aspects because it can be expressed both in words and actions. For example, when\nyou do good deeds, it means al-Hamdulillah, just as when you say good words.",

According to some scholars, the minimum dhikr that a Muslim is\nrequired to do is to maintain the adhkar after each salah or prayer. This kind of dhikr\nrequires very little of our time. It needs just few minutes and its reward is great. These\ndays, people rush out after the salah without reciting the recommended dhikr. We should\nremember that if we are in hurry and we have to leave immediately, we can still recite\nthem while we are walking.\nToday many Imams of mosques rush to the du'a after the salah. They do not wait for\npeople to recite the recommended dhikr after the salah. Adhkar u-al-Salawat is basically\npart of our ritual obligations that we have been ordered to do and so we should to fulfill\nthis obligation.\n2. Adhkar u-al-Sabahi wa al-Masa. According to some scholars, this type of adhkar is to be\nrecited after the Fajar prayer in the morning and after the Maghrib prayer in the evening.\nSome other scholars say it is recommended before sunrise and before sunset. Whatever\nthe case, this adhakr consists of very important du'as that the Prophet, sallallahu 'alayhi\nwasallam, guided us to read during these two specific times. There are many forms of this\ntype of du'a but we do not have to read or memorize all of them. We just need to choose\nsome of them. Some scholars say that we can choose only some of Adhkar u-al-Sabahi wa\nal-Masa but we have to maintain them regularly everyday. The Prophet, sallallahu 'alayhi\nwasallam, used to read some of these adi'yah regularly in the morning and evening and so\nwe are also allowed do so on an everyday basis.\nAl-Imam al-Nawawi himself has compiled a book called \"Kitab Adhkar u Alyoum WaLaiylah\" and discusses in detail about this type of adhkar. It is recommended to read and\nmaintain these adhkar everyday. It is easy and takes only five to ten minutes of our time.\n3. Adhkar u-al-Ahwal. This adhkar is to be recited during specific occasions. For example,\nwhen you want to eat you are supposed to recite \"Bismillah\" and when you finish eating\nthere is a du'a to be recited. Similarly, when entering the mosque there is a du'a, when\ngoing out of the mosque there is also a du'a, when you enter your house there is a du'a\nand so on. A Muslim has to read these adi'yah and memorize some of them. They are\nvery simple to memorize and easy to recite. We have to make them part of our lives.\nMost of us are, al-Hamdulillah, already practicing this. This type of du'a is very much\nrecommended during traveling, coming back from travel, during storms and also on\nmany other occasions.\nAccording to Sheikh al-Sa'di, one of the contemporary Mufasir, a person who maintains these\nthree types of adhkar regularly is considered among those who remember Allah a lot, as\nmentioned in many verses of the holy Qur'an. So one has to read and preserve this kind of dhikr\nAllah but al-dhikr, in general, can be freely recited and there is no limit to the amount of dhikr\nthat one can recite. Sheikh al-Sa'di, while commenting on the Ayah in Surah al-Ahzab further\nsaid that dhikr Allah is an obligation and we must fulfill this obligation.",

Ibn al-Haitham stated that al-dhikr should be recited with full awareness of its\nmeaning and not just read by the tongue without understanding it. If a person reads the adhkar\nwith full comprehension, he or she will get more rewards. And he/she will feel the pleasure of\niman and also the iman itself will increase.\nSo from these statements we can understand that there are three conditions for getting more\nrewards in our dhikr. The first one is to read the three types of dhikr in their specific occasions.\nSecondly, to recite the dhikr with full awareness and understanding of its meaning. And finally,\nto continue and maintain the recitation of these dhikr regularly everyday.\nThe third part of the hadith is about the prayer (salah) and it's position in Islam. The hadith says:\n\"Al-Salah (the prayer) is a light\". According to Ibn Rajab, prayer is indeed a light for the\nbelievers in their lives. It is also a light in their hearts and delights the inner parts of their body.\nThey will be guided by the salah and will be given enlightenment and satisfaction in their hearts.\nThat is why the salah is a delight of the eyes of the righteous people. Al-Imam Ahmed recorded\na hadith saying that the Prophet, sallallahu 'alayhi wasallam, used to say: \"The delight and pleasure\nof my eyes is in the salah\".\nIn another hadith the Prophet, sallallahu 'alayhi wasallam, said: \"When a servant of Allah preserves\nand safeguards the salah and performs it perfectly in terms of its ablution, its sujud, and ruku'\nthen the salah will say to him: 'May Allah preserve and safeguard you as you preserved and\nsafeguarded me', and then the salah will be taken by the angels up to the heavens while it has\nlights until it reaches Allah subhana wa ta'ala and it will do shafa'ah or intercession for the servant\nof Allah.\" In another similar hadith that is recorded by Imam Ahmed in his al-Musnad, the\nProphet, sallallahu 'alayhi wasallam, said: \"Whoever preserves the salah, it will be a light, proof and\nsafe place for him during the Day of Judgment.\" The hadith also states the importance and\nsignificance of the salah for the believers who always perform it in its right time and right way.\nThe hadith further explains the role of sadaqah (charity) in our lives. It says charity is a burhan\n(proof) for the Muslim. Burhan literally means 'sunlight' in Arabic. This emphasises that charity is\na bright and clear proof like the sunlight. It is a proof that reflects the iman of the believer.\nPeople who pay charity regularly for the sake of Allah express a strong iman. They feel the\npleasure of iman in their hearts. Imam Ibn Rajab says that the reason why charity is an evidence\nof iman is that people usually love wealth and money and if they challenge this love and\noverpower their greed for the sake of Allah, they indeed have strong iman.\nThe hadith says \"Patience is a dhiya' or brightness\". According to Ibn Rajab, linguistically al-dhiya'\n(brightness) is different from al-nur (light).

It requires a lot of effort and struggle\nwithin. So when people control themselves and overcome impatience, they develop a good habit\nof self-control and become masters of their own selves. This is the real meaning of al-sabr or\npatience. Al-sabr literally means to 'withhold' or control something. It means to control the nafs\nand prevent it from being in a state of panic or impatience. It also means to prevent the tongue\nfrom complaining or saying negative things. People do not practice this value. They become\nimpatient for minor reasons. They seem to be against the qadar and plans of Allah in their lives.\nImam Ibn Rajab says that there are three kinds of al-sabr or patience in Islam:\n1. Al-Sabru ala da'ati allahi - to be patient in performing the acts of worship or ibadah of\nAllah subhana wa ta'ala.\n2. Al-Sabru an ma'asi allahi - to be patient in the acts of avoiding sins (ma'asi) or disobedience\nof Allah subhana wa ta'ala.\n3. Al-Sabru ala aqdari allahi - to be patient with the Qadar of Allah or His plans which are\npredestined by Him and happens to us in our lives.\nSome scholars add a fourth kind of al-sabr to these three classifications: Al-Sabru ala al-bida' - to\nbe patient on matters related to religious innovations (but this can be included under the ma'asi\n(sins) or disobedience).\nOn the question of which of these three kinds of al-sabr is more important, Imam Ibn Rajab said\nthat to be patient in ibadah and to be patient in avoiding ma'asi or sins are more virtues than\nbeing patient with the qadar. One act of ibadah that contains all these three forms of al-sabr is\nfasting. For example, when fasting you obey Allah by performing the act of fasting, you avoid\nsins of eating during the day, and you believe that this is the plan of Allah and hence a test for\nyou.\nThe hadith also explains the role of the holy Qur'an in our lives. It states that \"The Qur'an is\neither an argument and proof for or against you\". In Surah al-Isra Ayah 82 Allah says:\n\"We send down the Qur'an that which is a healing and mercy for those who\nbelieve and for the unjust people it causes nothing but loss after loss.\"\nSo people who recite the Qur'an, learn it and practice its rulings are people who become the\npeople of the Qur'an and it (the Qur'an) will be a proof for them. But those who ignore the\nQur'an and never read or practice it in their lives, then the Qur'an will stand against them during\nthe Day of Judgment. One of contemporary scholars observed that people do not read the\nQur'an except when someone dies. They recite the Qur'an on a dead body but this is not the aim\nof the Qur'an. The Qur'an is revealed for the living and not for those who have passed away.",

O My servants, even if the first amongst you and\nthe last amongst you and the whole human race of yours and that of Jinns\nbecome as wicked as the most wicked heart of anyone amongst you, it will\nnot decrease anything from My Power or Kingdom. O My servants, even if\nthe first amongst you and the last amongst you and the whole human race\nof yours and that of Jinns gather together on a sector of land and all ask of\nMe and if I were to give everyone of them what they asked, that will not in\nany way decrease what I have anymore than a needle decreases what is in\nthe ocean when it is put into it. O My servants, these deeds of yours which\nI am recording for you I shall reward you for them, so he who finds good\nshould praise Allah and he who finds other than that should not blame\nanyone but himself.\"",

So a Muslim\nshould show his or her need to Allah all the time and should seek Allah's support and Tawfiq in\nwhatever he or she does. That is why we are ordered to do a lot of dhikr all the time because it\nexpresses our needs to Allah subhana wa ta'ala.\nIt is by the help of Allah that we are able to do things. We are able to move and walk. We are\nable to sleep and wake up and do all our activities. All our internal bodily systems such as\nbreathing, blood circulation and digestion and so on depend and work on Allah's Will. If any of\nthese functions stop working, no one can bring it back to normal except Allah. So we should\nalways be grateful to Allah subhana wa ta'ala.\nMost people remember Allah only when there is a problem. For example, when one of our\nbodily functions does not work properly (e.g. an injured muscle, a broken finger, etc.), it is only\nthen that we remember the bounties of Allah and what He provided us. But we should not wait\nuntil a problem occurs to be grateful to Allah. We have to be grateful to Him all the time and\nthank Him for all His Ni'mah on us. This will increase our iman because the more we show our\nneeds to Allah, the more we feel the bounty of Allah. People who are not grateful to Allah are\nconsidered arrogant because they do not recognize the bounties of Allah given to them.\nGuidance is a great mercy and ni'mah from Allah the Almighty. It is very important for every\nMuslim to know that the most valuable thing that we have in our life is this guidance. Allah has\nguided us to the right path or iman and we have to be grateful to Him. This guidance in the form\nof the Qur'an was revealed to us by Allah through His Messenger, Muhammad, sallallahu alayhi\nwasallam. So we should stick to its guidance and follow its teachings as a guide for us in\neverything we do in our lives. Our efforts alone cannot guide us. Even though we have our own\nwill and choice, they are not independent. They are under Allah's will and choice and belong to\nHim. We have aql (mind) but again it is created by Allah. We also have fitrah or the natural\ndeposition but it is also created by Allah and belongs to Him. All these things are created by\nAllah. Allah showed us the right way to follow and be guided and warn us against Shaitan who is\nour greatest enemy and cause of our wrongdoings and misguidance. Allah also showed us how\nto deal with our own desires which He created in us. He told us that we should not be misled by\nthese desires. We have to use them in the right ways.\nWhen it comes to the issue of misguidance, we must know that it is not from the choice of Allah\nbecause He does not want us to be misguided. It is from our own will and choice. When\nsomeone is misguided it is his or her own attitude and behavior and it is he or she who chooses\nit to be like that. For example, takabur (arrogance) is one source of misguidance but it is a\nperson's character and attitude which affect the heart and cause misguidance. So when a person\nchooses to be misguided he or she will be so by his or her own will and not by Allah's\nmisguidance. Allah's misguidance comes later as punishment for the person who chooses to be\nmisguided. But if the person is misguided because of external factors which is out of his hands,\nhe will be excused.

People who live\nin periods between two prophets (Ahlul Fatrah) are considered as being in excusable situations\nbecause they could not receive the messages of Allah at that period of time.\nAt the end of the hadith it is mentioned and stressed that whoever finds good record he should\nbe thankful to Allah and praise Him for that, and anyone who finds other than that, which\nmeans bad record, he should not blame anyone except himself. This is a clear statement that\nshows the personal responsibility of one's actions. It is the person's own will and choice and not\nAllah's. Allah is al-A'dil or Just. He never does injustice to His servants. In the Qur'an, we can\nfind many verses that explain how people blame themselves during the Day of Judgment for not\nfollowing the right path. It is the people themselves who chose to be misguided and hence they\ncannot blame any one else but themselves. This is also an important aspect of al-qadar that\nshould be understood.\nAccording to the scholars there are four types of guidance:\n1. Guidance needed for the welfare of the worldly life. This type is general guidance for all\nliving beings. They include Muslims and non-Muslims, animals and also other creatures.\nAll are guided by Allah for their worldly well-being.\n2. Guidance which benefits mankind in the religious sense. This type is beneficial for life in\nthe Hereafter.\n3. Guidance in terms of placing faith and guidance into the heart of a person. This can be\ndone only by Allah, as mentioned in Surah al-Kahf, Ayah 117.\n4. Guidance in the Hereafter as stated in Surah Yunus, Ayah 9. This fourth guidance is a\nresult of the second guidance. Those who follow the message of Allah are guided to the\nright path and will be guided in the Hereafter.\nThe door of Taubah or repentance is open for all. The acceptance of our repentance is always\navailable. Islam is a practical religion. It acknowledges our weaknesses. People are always subject\nto wrongdoings. They may neglect or delay performing obligations (wajib) or they may even\nindulge in sins (ma'asi') but Allah subhana wa ta'ala is Oft-Forgiving and His door is open to all\nwrongdoers.\nWe are given the chance to repent and come back to Allah. This is a mercy from Allah. If we\ntruly repent to Allah, our sins will be forgiven and even the bad records will be changed into\ngood ones. Allah is telling us that He is Forgiving, Merciful and Compassionate. He requires us\nto come to Him and seek His forgiveness. We should know that the door of Allah is open to us\nall the time. If we do something wrong at night, we should come back to Him in the morning\nand if we do something wrong in the morning, we should come to seek His forgiveness during\nthe night.

The more they ask Him, the more He gives them His Ni'mah and countless Bounties.\nHe wants us to ask Him more and seek His help and support. This is different from human\nbeings because humans do not like to be asked frequently. The more you ask a human, the more\nthey hate you and eventually will turn away from you. But the more we ask Allah the more He\ngives us. He wants us to come closer to Him and show Him our needs and humbleness. He will\nbe pleased by our frequent taubah and repentance. This is also a kind of ibadah which is required\nto be practiced.\nThe early scholars (al-Salaf) used to ask Allah a lot and always seek His help in everything, even\nwhen a part of their shoe is cut they ask Allah to repair it for them. This shows that they were\ntotally relying on Allah subhana wa ta'ala in their lives. We should also depend on Allah alone. We\nshould not depend on our material aspects such as money and wealth as they cannot do\nanything for us. It is Allah alone Who deserves to be relied on. So every Muslim should be\ncloser to Allah and seek His help and support. This will give us strength in our faith and iman.

They\nobserve the prayer as we do, and they keep the fasts as we do, and they\ngive sadaqah (charity) from their surplus riches.\" Upon this he (the\nProphet) said: \"Has Allah not prescribed for you (a course) by following\nwhich you can also do sadaqah? Verily in every tasbih (i.e. saying\nSubhanallah) there is a sadaqah, every takbir (i.e. saying Allahu Akbar) is a\nsadaqah, every tahmid (i.e. saying Alhamdulillah) is a sadaqah, every tahlil\n(i.e. saying Lailaha illallah) is a sadaqah, enjoining of good is a sadaqah,\nforbidding of evil is a sadaqah, and having sexual intercourse with your\nwife is a sadaqah. They (the Companions) said: \"O Messenger of Allah, is\nthere reward for him who satisfies his sexual passion among us?\" He said:\n\"Tell me, if he were to devote it to something forbidden, would it not be a\nsin on his part? Similarly, if he were to devote it to something lawful, he\nshould have a reward.\"\n[Muslim]\nBackground\nIn another hadith recorded by both Muslim and Al-Bukhari, it is mentioned that the questioners\nwere the poor of the Muhajruun or immigrants from Makkah. Ibn Rajab says that this hadith\nshows that those poor people thought that giving sadaqah (charity) can only be done through\nmoney, something which they could not afford. The Prophet, sallallahu alayhi wasallam, told them\nthat all good deeds are considered as charitable acts.\nThere are other versions this hadith of Abu Dharr as well as some other hadiths which show\nsimilar meanings. One of them is in Sahih Muslim which says that: \"Every good act is an act of\ncharity\". In another version the hadith, it says: \"Your smile to your brother is a charitable act.\nOrdering good is a charitable act. Forbidding evil is a charitable act. Helping a man who has bad\neyesight to see things is a charitable act. Removing a stone, rubbish or bones is a charitable act.\nEmptying your cup in the cup of your brother is a charitable act.\"\nAlso in the Sahihain (Al-Bukhari and Muslim) it is mentioned that \"A man spending money\nupon his wife is charity\". In another hadith in the Sahihain it is mentioned that \"No Muslim\nplants a plant or soils a seed and has it eaten by a bird, animal or human except that it will be a\ncharitable act for him\".",

They had very strong desires to do\nal-khayr and charity in order to please Allah subhana wa ta'ala. They were sad when they could not\nafford to donate their money to charity especially as it was being done by some other people.\nThey had a strong desire to spend they wealth and to do good deeds when they saw some\nmembers among the Companions doing it. They wanted to be like them in terms of rewards and\ntawab. They were able to do salah, fasting and other ibadah but one thing they could not do was\ngiving money or sadaqah because they did not have any. But they were told to do more dhikr\nwhich is equal to giving money or charity in terms of rewards.\nWe can see here how the Companions were so keen to do all forms and acts of ibadah in order\nto please Allah subhana wa ta'ala. This should be the case with every Muslim. We should be eager\nto do every good deed which pleases Allah. At least we should have the will and desire to do it\neven if we cannot do it.\nIbn Rajab states that the Islamic concept of charity in its broad sense can be divided into two\ntypes: -\n1. The acts of goodness and kindness one can have towards other humans. Ibn Rjab gave\nsome examples such as education and teaching people, teaching the Qur'an, removing\nanything that harms people in their paths, and also doing whatever that contributes to\nthe well-being of the Muslim community. This also includes making du'a (prayer) and\nistighfar (forgiveness) for the other Muslims.\n2. Keeping any harmful action away from others. This means that we must not perform a\nharmful act towards other people if it does not benefit them. It is the minimum thing\nthat one can afford to do to benefit others.\nCharitable acts are rewarded even without niyah or intentions. This can be understood from the\nfirst impression or the general observable meaning of the text of the hadith. But it seems that Ibn\nRajab is not happy with this interpretation. He says that a charitable act, according to many\nscholars, is conditional to a good intention. That is we must do it for the sake of Allah only and\nto seek His Pleasure. According to Ibn Rajab, this view is supported by two evidences:\n1. In another version of the hadith good intention was mentioned and hence it applies to the\nother places where good intention was not mentioned.\n2. In Surah al-Nisa Ayah 114, Allah says: \"There is no good in most of their secret talks\nexcept one who exhorts to a good deed of charity or goodness or conciliation between\npeople.

This\nshow us the importance if dhikr Allah. There are general types of dhikr and there are specific\ntypes of dhikr. Muslims should remember Allah all the time. The recommended time to do dhikr\nis during the morning and the evening and after the salawat. Every Muslim should maintain and\nobserve the dhikr in order to become among those who are described as al-dhakirun.\nThe acts of pleasing Allah are very wide and affordable to everyone. People differ in their ability,\npreference, potential, etc. There is room for all where every one has the ability to perform some\nact of charity. Therefore a Muslim should take this advantage and do good deeds which are\nmore convenient and suitable for him or her. However, we are encouraged to do as much of\ngood deeds and charitable acts as we can.\nThere is story that Imam al-Dhahabi related about a dialogue between Ibn al-Juwairiyah and\nImam Malik. He said that Ibn al-Juwairiyah wrote a letter to Imam Malik about ibadah and\nadvised him to do more acts of worship. Imam Malik was well known for his lectures in the\nMasjid al-Nabawi where he used to disseminate ilm (knowledge) and the sunnah of the Prophet,\nsallallahu alayhi wasallam, that he learned. Ibn Juwairiyah was known of his piety and devotions to\nworship. Imam Malik replied Ibn al-Juwairiyah's letter saying that Allah has divided the acts of\ndeeds among people as He divided rizq or wealth among them. Some are given talents in\nknowledge and how to spread it while others are given talents in jihad, fasting and so on. So what\nhe (Imam Malik) was given is not less than what Ibn al-Juwairiyah have been given and he\nhoped that both of them are on the right track and do the things that please Allah subhana wa\nta'ala.\nAlso In the stories of the Sahabah we can find that every one was good at doing some specific\nacts. This means talents are divided among people. Ibn Masud said that fasting the sunnah\nprevented him from reciting the Qur'an. It made him weak. So he chose the recitation of the\nQur'an over the non-obligatory fasting.

Only a few people may have the ability to do many things together. One\nof them was Abu Bakar al-Siqdiq, radiyallahu 'anhu. He was given the talents to perform all forms\nof ibadah and was good at doing them.\nIbn al-Qayyim mentions said that it is recommended to compete towards good deeds as\nmentioned in the Qur'an. People are allowed to compete for goodness and for the acts of charity\nin accordance with their talents and ability.

Some are given talents in\nknowledge and how to spread it while others are given talents in jihad, fasting and so on.

He used to walk around the streets of the\nvillage and cleaned the roads and streets. Every morning after the Fajar prayers he would go to\nthe school and clean the muddy and dusty road to that school. He was an illiterate man but yet\nhe did a lot of good jobs for the villagers which other people did not bother to do. This is\nindeed a great deed in the sight of Allah. It is a good opportunity to get the pleasure of Allah.\nTherefore every Muslim should be doing this kind of action which is actually easy and simple\nbut has great rewards. We cannot do all charitable acts at one time but we have to do whatever\nwe can do. We have to have the intention to do any charitable act. The hadith that says: \"Your\nsmile to your brother is a charitable act\" is a good example of this type of ibadah. It is common\nnow to see many people who have the habit of smiling at other people. They are in fact good at\nthis kind of charitable act. They are blessed with this behavior. It has a positive influence on\nother's behavior. When you smile to your brother and say \"Assalamu Alaikum\" to him, you are in\nfact making him happy and this act will create a good environment among the Muslim\ncommunity.\nScholars have emphasised the distinction between \"Ghibtah\" and \"Hasad\". Al-Ghibtah means to\nhave the desire to achieve the good qualities that others have. Al-Ghibtah is a positive behavior\nwhich motivates you to do good, as good as other people do. For example, when you see a\nknowledgeable person, you admire and wish to be knowledgeable like him; when you see\nsomeone who do a lot of ibadah, you wish to do the same; when you see a rich person who pays\ncharity, you admire him and wish to be like him. So you admire these people for their good\nactions and hence you wish to be like them. Al-Ghibtah, then, is actually good and desirable. It\ninfluences our attitude and behavior in a positive way.\nAl-Hasad, on the other hand, means 'envy'. It is a negative behavior which is prohibited and\ncondemned in Islam. The Prophet, sallallahu alayhi wasallam, said that al-Hasad demolishes the\nrewards. It is envy and jealousy that occurs when you see someone who is given some privileges\nthat you do not have. It is Allah who gives His Bounty to anyone He choses. So we should not\nfeel any objection to Allah's plan. That is why al-Hasad is considered a very bad behavior and a\nmajor sin.\nWe are encouraged to perform the acts of ordering good things and prohibiting evils because\nwhen we do it we contribute to the well-being of the society. We do not do it to offend or put\ndown someone. We do it in order to help them. Carrying out this concept will always contribute\nto the betterment of the whole society. We have to do it with tolerance and patience so that the\nother party may accept it. When we do this act with good intentions, the other person sees it\npositively. He sees it as caring and concern from our side. So most likely, he will accept it. We\nshould not do it in a harsh or aggressive way that it may offend others.",

Not from the angle of whether they are preferable (mandoub: if we do it, we will\nbe rewarded and if we do not do it, we will not be blamed) or obligatory (wajib). Sometimes\npreferable things become obligatory. For instance, if a blind man wants to cross the road and\nyou are the only one to help him, helping him becomes obligatory.

    "text": "- 137 -\nThis hadith emphasises the significance of certain deeds: bringing about justice between two\npeople and reconciling them. Getting people who deviated in their thoughts back to the\ncommunity is part of islah (reconciliation). When the Khawarej started thinking of fighting their\nown community, Abdullah bin Abbas, radiyallahu 'anhu, went to them and had a dialogue with\nthem. He tried to remove any misconceptions. He was successful in getting two-thirds of them\ninto the Muslim community. This is one meaning of charitable acts. Another meaning is to give\nhelp to those who are in need for help. We should not wait until we are asked. We have to offer\nhelp when we see people in need. This is what is meant by wala' (loyality) to the community.\nSaying a good word is a charitable act, as mentioned in Hadith 25. There are many ways that we\ncan do this. For example, when we notice that someone is unhappy, we can bring pleasure to\nhim by saying a good word to him and relieving his sadness or worry.\nAnother deed is the step to prayer. We know that prayer is obligatory, but by walking to prayer\nwe perform a charitable act in every step. When Muslims keep this in their minds, they will be\nencouraged to do such deeds.\nThe last charitable act that is mentioned in this hadith is removing a harmful thing from the road\nor from someone's pathway. Some people may look at this as insignificant or unimportant. But\nthis does not mean that the act is degrading. In the sight of Allah it is a great act and we will be\nrewarded for doing it. Doing such an act may prevent a terrible accident from happening. For\nexample, omitting a nail from the street may prevent car accidents and consequently keep the\nsafety of our community. We should not care about the comments of others because we are\ndoing it for the sake of Allah. The more we have the intention that we are doing these charitable\nacts for the sake of Allah, the more will be the reward from Allah subhana wa ta'ala.\nConclusion\nIslam calls for and encourages its followers to build a caring society, where members of the\nsociety care for one another, support one another and help one another. Social charitable acts\ndiscussed above are considered obligatory daily activities which form ways and means of being\nthankful to Allah. This concept needs to be promoted in the classroom, masjid and the media in\nevery possible way.\nUnfortunately, contemporary media plays a negative role in this sense. Movies promote negative\nvalues which lead to an uncaring society, resulting in, for example, selfishness, greediness and\nego-centric personalities.\nOne way of changing this negative role to a positive one is to change the existing concept of\nentertainment. Another alternative is to initiate new branches of communication such as\neducational communication and psychology of the media.",

These two hadiths state\nthe meaning of righteousness and sinfulness.\nLessons\nIbn Rajab states that the term 'bir' which is used in this hadith is actually used in two senses: (a)\ntreating others in a good manner, and (b) all acts of good deeds and worshipping Allah. Based\non this, the first statement in the first hadith can be interpreted as meaning the most essential\naspect of righteousness is good character. And Ibn Rajab extends this meaning by saying that\ngood character can be interpreted as all good manners mentioned in the Qur'an. Consequently,\naccording to Ibn Rajab, the two meanings of bir are there.\nAllah has created us with a pure innate or natural disposition that is called fitra, as mentioned in\nother hadiths. This means to love the truth and the good and to hate falsehood and evil.\nConsequently, good believers with pure fitra should never confuse truth with falsehood.\nThe second hadith guides us to consult our heart regarding doubtful matters. If the heart is in\ntranquility, that implies that it is bir or righteousness. If the heart is not tranquil, one should\nabstain from carrying out such an act or doubtful matter. However, it should be noted that fitra\nis subject to corruption and can be spoiled due to the influence of bad environment - a person\nmay start to like and appreciate what is bad or evil and dislike truth and goodness. Here, the\nheart is diseased or even dead. Such a person cannot use his heart as a measure to judge what is\ngood and bad because the fitra is already corrupted.\nSin is what wavers or trembles your soul. This portion of the hadith defines a sinful act as an act\nfor which its performer deserves blame. Imam Qurtabi gives the previous interpretation. Ustaz\nJamaludin Zarabozo states that in this hadith the Prophet, sallallahu 'alayhi wasallam, gave very\nimportant signs of sin. The first one is an internal sign within the human being. It is the feelings\nof the soul with respect to any particular act. The second sign is also about the internal feelings\nbut it deals with the outward reaction to the act itself. Sin causes a wholesome soul to be uneasy\nand troubled. The soul is unhappy and worried about sin and its consequences. Ustaz Jamaludin",

The commentators of this hadith stress\nthat the 'people' referred to here are the respected and righteous people.\nThe two hadiths reveal a significant aspect of Islam that is an internal controlling and guiding\nsystem that is established as a result of several factors:\n1. The pure fitra (natural disposition). Allah created everybody with a pure fitra and not just\nMuslims. The Prophet, sallallahu 'alayhi wasallam, mentions many factors in the\nenvironment that play an influential role in subjecting the fitra to corruption.\n2. The realization of tawhid. This means practicing all the essentials of tawhid like loving\nAllah, seeking His Help as the only refuge, depending on Him (tawakul), asking for His\nMercy, and many other essentials associated with the idea of tawhid.\n3. Adhering to shari'ah instructions.\n4. Seeking knowledge.\n5. Tazkiyah and tarbiyah - that is the purification of the soul and the heart of the Muslim.\nThe above mentioned factors and many others are interrelated and altogether lead to the\nestablishment of the internal controlling system. However, this system needs to be 'updated' and\n'upgraded' regularly by educators and da'ies. It is very important that the educators and da'ies pay\nattention to the individual's and the community's built-in system. They have to create awareness\nabout contemporary challenges. They should plan future strategies to deal with such challenges.\nThis internal system is very important for Muslims today. They should know about it in order to\nactivate it. Only through such proper reconstruction of the consciousness can we be certain\nabout the validity and effectiveness of the internal controlling system. Muslims need to be aware\nof this fact and have to activate their system in order to be sensitive towards doubtful acts and\nsinful matters. Unless this system is 'upgraded', the person may not act in the right way. It is like\n'installing' an 'anti-virus software' within ourselves. With such a 'software' in place, our internal\nsystem will prevent 'viruses', i.e. bad/evil acts, from entering our thoughts or hearts.\nThere are many issues today where people are in total doubt about whether something is\nallowed or not. In many areas such as insurance, food, medicine, trade, and technology, there are\nno definite answers - or the people themselves are not aware of the Islamic approach. This may\nlead to moral conflicts. Unfortunately, even some people who teach akhlaq and moral values are\nsometimes not even aware of these conflicts.\nIn this era we have several clashing values. Muslims should be exposed to the Islamic point of\nview of the issue in order to go for the right value. Works about such issues should be published\nand translated for all Muslims. Books and magazines should be available to all Muslims. If the\nexisting works are very long, we need to summarize the findings and translate them into major\nMuslim and international languages. Exposing Muslims to such findings will minimize disputes",

    "text": "- 144 -\nBackground\nIn one of the narrations of this hadith, it is mentioned that the Prophet, sallallahu 'alayhi wasallam,\ngave this talk after the Fajr prayer. Based on other hadiths, it was the practice of the Prophet,\nsallallahu 'alayhi wasallam, to give admonition to his companions from time to time, however,\nwithout burdening nor boring them. Ibn Rajab points out the characteristics of the Prophet's,\nsallallahu 'alayhi wasallam, speeches and admonitions: brief, concise, and conveyed in beautiful\nunderstandable manner.\nThe admonition consists of three main issues:\n1. To have taqwa of Allah where it is Allah's Advice to all mankind.\n2. To listen and obey the leaders for it will lead to better management of the affairs of the\ncommunity, of peace and unity. However, the hadith lays a fact that rightly-guided\nleadership will be the first Islamic concept to be violated.\n3. The hadith anticipates a historical fact: i.e. the Muslim disunity and split into groups and\nsects due to heresies. It indicates the main principle to be followed in such situations:\nadhering to the sunnah.\nThe emphasis, then, in the advice given in the hadith is to adhere to the sunnah and to avoid bid'ah\n(heresy).\nLessons\nIntroductory statements about adhering to the sunnah\nThe Prophet's, sallallahu 'alayhi wasallam, actions may be classified as follows:\n1. Those that are specific to the Prophet, sallallahu 'alayhi wasallam, such as continuous\nfasting (wisal).\n2. Actions that are related to the culture of his time, such as the turban, unbuttoning the\ntop shirt button, keeping long hair, using a walking stick.\n3. Actions resulting from spontaneous or haphazard actions. For example, the Prophet,\nsallallahu 'alayhi wasallam, used to stop at particular places during a journey or take a\ncertain route for a journey.\n4. Actions that the Prophet, sallallahu 'alayhi wasallam, performed intentionally for the\npurpose of ibadah.",

If there is a beneficial act that existed during the time of the Prophet, sallallahu 'alayhi\nwasallam, yet the Prophet, sallallahu 'alayhi wasallam, did not perform it as a act of ibadah,\nthen we cannot perform it as an act of ibadah.\nAn act of ibadah may be performed due to a number of reasons:\na.\nIf an act is considered a need to motivate people because of their laxity and\ncarelessness, then that act is a bid'ah and cannot be performed. For example,\nAbdul Malik bin Marwan gave the Eid khutbah before the prayer because people\nleft after the prayers.\nb. If the act is considered a need due to the natural circumstances of the people and\nthere was no need during the time of the Prophet, sallallahu 'alayhi wasallam, then it\nis considered as maslahah mursalah. For example, the compilation of the Qur'an,\nthe use of the mihrab, the existing schooling system, the use of loudspeakers\nduring the adhan, etc.\n3. If the Prophet, sallallahu 'alayhi wasallam, performed an act and then stopped due to a\ncertain reason, we may perform that act provided the reason no longer exists. For\nexample, the Tarawih prayers - the Prophet, sallallahu 'alayhi wasallam, stopped performing\nthem after a time because he was afraid that it would be made compulsory. After his\ndeath, there is no way that the Tarawih prayers will become compulsory as the time of\nwahy has passed.\n4. Avoiding any act of worship that the Prophet, sallallahu 'alayhi wasallam, did not perform\nis considered a sunnah (sunnah tarkiyyah).",

To remove these\nlimits, i.e. make more than the specified number of repetitions, is a bid'ah.\nb. Specifying a general evidence to a particular act. In other words, limiting an act\nthat is unlimited by the shari'ah. An example is to specifically fast on Friday and\npray on Friday evening. Other examples are to call the adhan for the Eid prayer\n(by using the general hadith for the adhan) and performing a certain set of dhikr for\na certain time/day. These acts are considered bid'ah.\n6. Connecting an act of ibadah to an unrelated action (either a natural action or a act of\nibadah) and making them appear as a continuous action, might be a bid'ah or lead to\nbid'ah, depending on the situation:\n\nIntentionally. This is a bid'ah.\n\nUnintentionally. If the connection is repeatedly made in public, then it could lead\nto a\nbid'ah\n(because people might think the actions were related).\nAn example is that at the time of Imam Malik, it was reported that the muadhin\nwould purposely clear his throat before giving the adhan. When he was made to\nstop by Imam Malik, he would then purposely hit a stick against the side of the\nminaret before giving the adhan. Imam Malik stopped him from doing this as\nwell, and said, \"Do not do something which has not been practised by the\nProphet,\nsallallahu\n'alayhi\nwasallam,\nnor\nby\nhis\ncompanions.\"\nAnother example is to stand up immediately after performing the fardh prayers to\nperform the sunnah prayers where people without knowledge may get confused.\nA third example is to start fasting the six days of Shawal from the second day of\nEid.\n7. Any non-obligatory action which is permitted by the shari'ah but by repeatedly\nperforming in public makes it appear to be a fardh, then that action should be stopped\noccasionally. An example is the recitation of Surah as-Sajdah and Surah al-Insan in the\nFriday Fajr prayer. Another is that the Companions (Abu Bakr and Umar) occasionally\ndid not perform udhiah.\n8.

[Qu'ran, Surah al-Sajdah (32): Ayah 1617]\nThen he said: \"Shall I not also tell you of the peak of the matter, its pillar,\nand its topmost part?\" I said: \"Yes, O Messenger of Allah.\" He said: \"The\npeak of the matter is Islam (submission to Allah), the pillar is prayer; and\nits topmost part is jihad.\" Then he said: \"And shall I not tell you of the\ncontrolling of all that ?\" I said:\" Yes, O Messenger of Allah\".

In general, the\nProphet Muhammad, sallallahu alayhi wasallam, gave the same answers. Ibn Rajab highlights\nanother narration of the hadith recorded by Imam Ahmad which states that Mu'adh came to the\nProphet, sallallahu alayhi wasallam, and said: \"O Messenger of Allah, I want to ask you about a\nmatter that has made me ill and burning from inside.\" The Prophet, sallallahu alayhi wasallam,\nsaid: \"Ask whatever you wish.\" He said: \"Inform me about a deed which will make me enter\nParadise.\"\nThis shows, as Ibn Rajab continues to say, Mu'adh's eagerness to know about good deeds.",

However, a person's good\ndeeds are part of Allah's mercy and grace. Allah says: \"But Allah who caused faith to be dear to\nyou and have given it beauty in your heart, and has made hateful to you denial of the truth and\nall inequity and all rebellion against what is good\" (Surah al-Hujarat (49): Ayah 7). So the\nmeaning of this verse has been emphasized by this hadith. The performing of good deeds is a\ncause of entering paradise but they are themselves a gift from Allah.\nThere are debates among some scholars about the actions and whether we deserve to enter\nParadise because of these actions. They raise the questions: Is it like a contract? Is it a deal? Or is\nthis actually just a cause but entering Paradise is Allah's Mercy? If we just look at the matter as a\ndeal or a contract, we would not be able to pay for even one of Allah's mercies.\nThe deeds that have been mentioned in this hadith have been emphasized in previous hadiths\ncollected by Imam An-Nawawi, mainly Hadith 2, 3, 15 and 23. However, there are two\nadditional good deeds mentioned in this hadith:\n1. A man's prayer in the middle of the night. This includes, according to Ibn Rajab, three\ntypes of people:\na.\nThose who wake up during the night for dhikr, du'a, or praying tahajud.\nb. Those who wait for the Isha' prayer and do not go to sleep until they perform\nIsha'.\nc.\nThose who wake up for the Fajr prayer.\nAll these three groups have been mentioned in the Qur'an. People who stay awake\nthroughout the night (busy in entertaining themselves) miss these blessed deeds. The\nthree types of people are guaranteed and promised with the blessing from Allah in the\nHereafter where there are unpredictable and unimaginable rewards.\n2. Jihad where and when it becomes an obligation (this deed is not stated clearly in other\nhadiths). It is a great blessing that gets Muslims closer to Allah. Scholars say that jihad is\nthe greatest act of worship and the most important deed after the obligatory acts.\nThrough jihad, Islam is protected and preserved and became dominant, where other\nnations lived under its rule peacefully with their rights maintained.\nIn Hadith 15, the Prophet, sallallahu alayhi wasallam, quoted the importance of saying good things\nor keeping silent.

Ibn Rajab states that this\nindicates that restraining and controlling our speech is the crucial matter of all good things. The\none who controls his tongue controls all his affairs.\nIn this hadith, we see the emphasis is on the negative side of the tongue, whereas in the previous\nhadiths, the emphasis is on the positive side of the tongue. This means that the tongue can be\nused in two ways: to say good things or to say bad things. Most people have the tendency to be\nlenient about this issue. Though Muslims know that saying bad things is prohibited, they still do\nso, saying things that displease Allah such as backbiting, slandering and spreading rumours. We\nwill be held accountable for what we say. We will be rewarded for saying good things and we\nmay be punished for saying bad things. Being cynical to others and saying things just for fun is\nsomething that a person is going to be accountable for. Even if a Muslim says things in the form\nof a cynical du'a (e.g. \"May Allah guide him\") or a joke to make fun of other Muslims and put\nhim down, he will be held against this action. Even using gestures or attributes in a cynical way\nthat can be interpreted that he is belittling a Muslim is considered a sinful act that displeases\nAllah.\nThe Muslim should have control over his tongue; otherwise his tongue can create a lot of\nproblems for the community. In the fitnah (troubles) during Caliphate Othman, radiyallahu 'anhu,\nthe Companions said they were considering saying bad things in that critical situation as a way of\nhelping those who killed him. Consequently, the Muslim is always a good person who says only\ngood things and for the benefit of his community. He should not say anything that may lead to\nany disputes among the Muslim community.\nAnother thing that is related to this and is mentioned by the scholars is the story of a man (from\nan Israel tribe) that the Prophet, sallallahu alayhi wasallam, narrated: \"There were two relatives or\nbrothers. One of them was pious and righteous and the other one used to commit sins. The\npious person always tried to remind the sinful one, but he did not do so in the appropriate way\nof making da'wa. One day while he was passing by the sinner he said: 'I swear by Allah that He\nwill not forgive you!' Upon this Allah said: 'Who is putting himself higher than My Authority?!\"\nSo Allah forgave the sinner and held the pious one accountable for what he said even though he\nwas righteous.\"\nThis teaches us that we have to watch what we say especially when we are angry. That's why the\nProphet, sallallahu alayhi wasallam, made the du'a : \"I ask Allah to enable me to say the truth\nwhether I am angry or pleased.\" Controlling ourselves needs training and effort. That's why we\nneed al-tarbiyyah and al-tazkiyyah. This will be difficult in the beginning. But when we show Allah\nthat we are serious, Allah will give us help and al-tawfiq (guidance) to the right path. Muslims\nneed to make sincere efforts to reach a high degree of tarbiyyah and tazkiyyah. This will be part of\ntheir akhlaq. Muslims need ilm (knowledge) because if they are not aware of this, they may\nmisinterpret things and get into sinful acts. Ibn Rajab says if the Muslim can control his tongue,\nhe can control his other affairs. That is the wisdom that Muslims can get from this hadith.",

Ibn Rajab says if the Muslim can control his tongue,\nhe can control his other affairs. That is the wisdom that Muslims can get from this hadith.",

If the family life\nis not carried out in accordance with shari'ah, we will end up with many people transgressing the\nset limits. For example, the way divorce takes place violates the concept of family relationship\nwhere the spouses are not aware of what they say. They are not in control of their tempers.

The Muslim should realize that all provisions come from Allah and not simply the result\nof his own acts. He should trust Allah and what Allah has more than what he has in his\nhands.\n2. If he loses anything in this world, this should not bother him because he is looking for its\nreward.\n3. The Muslim should not care whether he is going to be blamed or praised by others. He\nwill not look for praise. In his heart, he is not touched by such praise. And if he is\nblamed, he will not be offended by being blamed. If the accusation is not true, he has\nnothing to worry about; if it is true then he has to face it and try to be a better Muslim.\nWe can also try to see and compare what was narrated by Al-Imam Abu Muslim Al-Hawlani and\nwhat has been narrated by other scholars. Al-Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal was asked one day if\nsomeone owns one thousand dinar, can he still be a zahid? He replied yes, he can be still a zahid\nif he does not feel rejoice if the money increases and he does not become sad if it decreases. We\nmust not become slaves to money or our worldly possessions. We can be wealthy and zahid if we\nare still thankful to Allah and use wealth in the right way (provided also that we obtained this\nwealth in the right way). This meaning has been emphasised by Sufian Ibn 'Uyainah, one of the\ngreat scholars, when he was asked who is to be considered as zahid. He said whoever Allah\nbestowed a bounty on him then he is thankful and then when he is under trial, he is patient.\nSufian Al-Thawri - another scholar - said: Al-zuhd in this world is that you are ready in your\nheart and think of the Hereafter - you think of death. We should be prepared for the next world.\nThis is a definition of zuhd. Zuhd means a status of the heart where a person fears he will not live\na long life. This will motivate every one to be a good Muslim. If we have this feeling that we are\ngoing to leave this world at any time, this will lead us to be closer to Allah and fulfill our\nobligations and also to get away from disobedience.\nThis is why some scholars point out that there are different types of zuhd:\n\nAl-zuhd in disobedience and sin\n\nNot to be misled by our desires.\n\nNot to exceed the limits of the permissible or the allowable acts (mubah). For example,\nwe should not exceed the limits of sleeping (i.e. sleeping unnecessarily long hours) or\neating (i.e. eating too much) which is permissible.\nIbn Rajab said the one who is hopeless of living a long life, then he is looking forward to\nmeeting Allah and he is eager for the Hereafter - this is the maximum level of zuhd. Ibn Rajab\nthen says that looking at this worldly life as blameworthy is not because of the day or night,",

The text of this hadith becomes one of the most important maxims. Later on\nother maxims were derived from the text of this hadith. Some of them are as follows:\n1. Harm is to be prevented from appearing as much as possible.\n2. Harm is to be eradicated.\n3. Harm is not to be removed by a similar harm.\n4. A greater harm can be removed by a lesser harm.\nBased on maxim number 4, it was realised that if someone has no other options, he\nshould take the lesser of the two harms. Another situation is that if there is a conflict\nbetween two harms, precedence is given to avoiding the greater harm.\n5. The presence of a particular harm is accepted towards a general harm.\n6. Preventing harm takes precedence over gaining or attaining benefits.\n7. If there is a conflict between factors permitting something and others prohibiting\nsomething, the prohibition takes precedence; that is, it is going to be given the priority.\n8. Something harmful is not given precedence just because it was pre-existing. In other\nwords, the pre-existence of something does not allow it to continue to exist and be the\ncause of harm.\nThere is a real story related to maxim number 8. This story took place in Al-Andalus (Muslim\nSpain) where the people built a mosque. After several years or decades, many houses had been\nbuilt around the mosque and at that time when the mu'zin wanted to make the call for prayer\n(Adhan), he used to climb up to the minaret. The fuqaha (jurists) ruled that the mu'zin should stop\ngoing up to the minaret in order not to cause any harm (from the minaret, one was able to see\ninto other people's homes and thus invade their privacy).\nAnother maxim is if there is a conflict between individual harm and public harm, the prohibition\nof public harm will take precedence. The above are some of the maxims that are derived from\nthe text of this present hadith.\nWhen scholars talk about doing things right from the first time either based on experience or\nanticipation that certain things will cause harm, they urge people to take precautions to prevent\nany kind of harm. There are books written by Imam Muslim on this issue. When we look at\nthese maxims, we see that they are very great where we have to anticipate the harm and not to\nallow it to take place. If it takes place, efforts should be done in order to bring it to an end or to\nremove it. If it cannot be removed, we should try our best to minimize the harm.",

The second part of hadith (harming) means that the\nperson causes harm to someone else which is not even beneficial for him.\nFor example, suppose a person builds another floor (story) on top of his house and this\nresults in his house being higher than his neighbours. This is beneficial to him but it\ncauses harm to his neighbours as it invades their privacy. Ibn Rajab also says that the\nProphet, sallallahu 'alayhi wasallam, rejected causing harm if there is no valid reason.\nHowever, in the punishment of a criminal, there would be harm but the reason is valid.\nThe aim here is to bring justice. In bringing justice, if there is any harm to an unjust\nperson or criminal, then this harm is legal and allowed.\nCausing harm without a valid or good reason\n1. Ibn Rajab says the Prophet, sallallahu 'alayhi wasallam, said that if the main objective is to\nactually cause the harm, then this is totally prohibited.

(Mahmassani 168).\nTherefore it becomes important to know upon who the onus of proof lies. There is no doubt\nthat the burden is upon the plaintiff. This is explained by the fact that what is apparent is\npresumed to be the original state; any one who makes a claim to the contrary must prove such\nclaim. (ibid)\nThe proof of a matter requires presentation of evidence until the matter attains the degree of\ncertainty. Certainty is that which can be established by sight or proof. It can only be dispelled by\nanother certainty. (ibid)\nSince it is established that a defendant is presumed to be free from liability until the claimant\nproves the contrary, it is important to know who is the defendant and who is the plaintiff, who\nof the two must bear the onus of proof, and whose evidence takes precedence in case of\nconflict. (ibid p172).\nThe definition of \"Plaintiff\" and \"Defendant\"\nThere are three views regarding the above issue (Zarabozo 3/ 1167):\n1. The plaintiff is the one who is not charged with anything or can remain silent of the two\ndisputants.\n2. The plaintiff is the one who is claiming something other than what is apparent or what\nhas not yet been established in the past. The defendant is the one who is on the opposite\nside, arguing to what is apparent.\n3. The defendant is the one rejecting a claim while the plaintiff is the one making the claim.\nThe meaning of al-Bayinah or \"proof\" (ibid)\nMany jurists seem to think that \"proof\" refers only to witnesses. However, the meaning of proof\nis much more comprehensive and also applies to means of proof other than witnesses.\nAccording to some early and contemporary scholars, \"al-Bayinah\" or proof is a noun that\nencompasses all means of establishing the truth. Circumstantial evidence, conclusive\npresumption, and clear signs that lead to a definite conclusion can all be taken into consideration\n.",

In Ibn Taymiyyah's al-Amar it is\nstated that it is necessary to possess the knowledge of good and evil and of the difference\nbetween them, and it is necessary to know the situation of the person being commanded\nor forbidden.\n3. Hikmah (Wisdom) - which means saying or doing the right thing in the right way at the\nright time to the right person, as prescribed by Allah in His statement: Call to the way of\nyour Lord with wisdom and beautiful admonition. [Surah an-Nahl (16): Ayah 125]\n4. Ibn Taymiyyah wrote: Enjoin the good in a good way and do not forbid the evil in an vil\nway.\n5. Hilm (Forbearance) and Rifq (Gentleness) - especially in the face of opposition from the\npeople. As Allah said to His Messenger, sallallahu 'alayhi wasallam: And by the Mercy of\nAllah you were able to deal gently with them. If you had been severe and harsh-hearted,\nthey would have broken away from you. [Surah al-Imran (3): Ayah 159]\nThe Prophet, sallallahu 'alayhi wasallam, also said: Indeed gentleness does not enter into\nanything except it beautifies it, nor is it removed from anything except that it makes it\nugly [Reported by Imam Muslim].\n6. Sabr (Patience) - since the people whom the Caller opposes in enjoining good and\nforbidding evil, may be stubborn to his call and may even try to harm him.\nIbn Taymiyyah says in al-Istiqaamah, concerning the call to the good and away\nfrom the evil: Knowledge must precede it, gentleness must accompany it and\npatience must follow it. Shaikh al-Humaid, the teacher of Shaikh Ibn Baz, said, in\nan explanation of Surah al-'Asr that Allah makes an oath that mankind will be in a\nstate of deficiency, except with four conditions, which are: (a) iman, (b) good\nactions, (c) encouraging each other to the truth which means enjoining the good\nand forbidding the evil, and (d) encouraging each other to patience, which is\nrequired after enjoining good and forbidding evil. Furthermore each person will\nhave a level of deficiency in accordance with the level of lack of any of these four.\n6. Tawaadu' (Humility) - since the people will not heed if the Caller is arrogant or he seeks\nto put himself above others.\n7. Qudwah (Good example) - for the Caller himself becomes a model to the people to\nwhom he calls, doing those things which he enjoins and leaving those things which he\nforbids. Allah says: O you who believe! Why do you say that which you do not do. It is a\nmost hateful thing to Allah that you say that which you do not do. [Surah as-Saff (61):\nAyah 2-3]\n8. Husnul-Istimaa' (Good listening) - which is that the Caller is attentive to the needs and\nfeelings and also the complaints of the people whom he calls.",

    "text": "- 179 -\nBackground\nUnity is one of the greatest objectives of Islam. There are many verses in the Qur'an that urge\nMuslims to unite. In Surah al-'Imran, Ayah 103, Allah says:\nAnd hold fast, all of you together, to the Rope of Allah (which is Islam) and be\nnot divided among yourselves.\nThis is a very well-known verse to Muslims. In Surah al-Taubah, Ayah 71, Allah says:\nThe believing men and women are 'awliya' (loyal) to one another.\nThere are many other verses in the Qur'an that urge joining unity, as well as verses that forbid\ndisunity. We can see this in the same Surah al-'Imran, Ayah 103, in which Allah says:\n…and be not divided among yourselves.\nSo in the same verse the Muslims are asked to be united and prevented from disunity. The\nQur'an contains many such verses, for example: Surah al-'Imran Ayah 105-107; Surah al-Hujurat\nAyah 10; Surah al-An'am Ayah 153 and 159; and in Surah al-Rum Ayah 31-32. All of these\nverses and many others in the Qur'an forbid the division or split of the Muslim community.\nMoreover, we have many hadiths that command the Muslims to be united. One hadith is recorded\nby Imam Muslim: \"Verily Allah likes three things for you and disapproves three things for you:\nHe is pleased with you but you worship Him and disassociate anything with him; that you hold\nfast to the Rope of Allah and not to be scattered (disunited); and He disapproves for you\nirrelevant talk, persistent questioning, and wasting of wealth.\"\nWe find that Islam commands the Muslims to practice things that will bring unity - there are\nconditions and actions where the Muslims need to perform to accomplish this. At the same\ntime, we also find that there are many actions that Islam forbids because these actions may lead\nto the disunity of the Muslim ummah. This Hadith 35 falls in the latter category.\nLessons\nThe first action that the hadith forbids is envy (al-hasad). Muslim scholars like Imam Ghazali and\nothers define envy as disliking to see a person receiving a bounty and wishing that he or she (the\nreceipient) would lose it.\nIbn Rajab gives a different and broader definition. He states in his definition that it is part of\nhuman nature that a person dislikes anyone to be better than him in virtues. He says that people\ndiffer in their attitudes and he lists five categories of envy that people have:",

There are others who will then try to get that bounty transferred to them. So they firstly\ntry to take it away from the person they envy and then they try to get it for themselves.\nFor instance, if a certain person is offered a certain position or authority, the envious one\nwill try to do something by hand or by speech to take away that position or authority\nfrom that person. Then he will try to get that status or position transferred to himself.\n3. There are some people who do not make any effort by action or speech to harm the one\nwhom they envy. Ibn Rajab says this category of people can be of two types:\na.\nThe one who does his best to eliminate the feeling of envy within himself but he\ncannot overcome it. In spite of this, he keeps fighting and struggling against it.\nIbn Rajab says this type of person is excused from punishment.\nb. The one who thinks about envy and practices it again and again. He does not\nmake any effort to fight it even though he does not do any harm by action or\nspeech. But he actually enjoys and practices envy - he wishes that the bounty of\nthe envied one will be lost. Consequently, this person is subject to punishment.\n4. There are those who, whenever they envy someone, do not harm him or her. They do\nnot even wish the loss of the bounty from the envied one. Instead, they make the effort\nto attain a similar bounty or virtue for themselves. Ibn Rajab says: \"If this bounty is\nwordly virtues or worldly bounties, there is no benefit in that.\" For example, if you see\nsomeone who has a Mercedes, and you try to attain a similar car for yourself, then there\nis no benefit in that. But if it is a righteous virtue, then it is good.\n5. There are some people who, whenever they feel envy, do their best to stop it and they\nwill do a favour or something good for the person whom they envied. In addition, they\nwill also make du'a for that person until they love him - because envy is usually associated\nwith hatred. They will wish that the envied ones are better than them - they do not\nbother themselves if others have things which are better than what they have. Ibn Rajab\nsays these people are the best category of true believers since everyone is subject to\nindulge or be trapped by envy or being envious of others.\nWhy is envy (hasad) forbidden?\nIt can cause - by the permission of Allah - harm to others whom are envied. Consequently, they\nare considered as evil acts in Islam. They can cause - even by just wishing - the harming of a\nperson. It is the virtue of Shaitan. And it is also the virtue of Jews to envy other people. This is\nmentioned in Surah al-Baqarah, Ayah 109 and in Surah al-Nisa', Ayah 54.\nThe Prophet, sallallahu 'alayhi wasallam, warned Muslims against envy when he said \"Creeping\nupon you is the diseases of those people before you: envy and hatred. And hatred is the thing\nthat shapes. I do not say it shapes the hair but it shapes the religion. By the One in whose Hand\nis my soul, you will not enter paradise until you believe, and you will not believe until you love\none another. Certainly, let me inform you of that which may establish such things: spread the\ngreetings and peace among yourselves.\" [Recorded by Imam Ahmad and Al-Tirmidhi]",

According to the\nMuslim scholars, it would be preferable to recite them after the five prayers along with Ayat-ulKursi.\nAl-Tanajush is translated literary as \"do not artificially inflate the prices against one another\".\nNajash that is mentioned in this hadith can be interpreted, according to Ibn Rajab, in two ways:\n1. It can be interpreted as bai' al-najash - the trading where a person offers a high price for a\ncertain item not for the sake of buying it but for the sake of raising the price of the item\nso that in the end it is sold for more than its actual price/worth. This is usually done,\neven in the Muslim world today, by a previous agreement by the salesman and another\nperson or relative who pretends that he wants to buy. This is done in the stock market or\nauctions where there is a person who keeps bidding higher prices for an item. He is\ndoing a favour for the person who wants to sell. This is considered as bai' al-najash. The\nmajority of Muslim jurists (fuqaha) say it is valid. However, they say that if the buyer finds\nthat he has been manipulated in a way where the price exceeded drastically over the\nactual price, then he has the choice of returning the item.\n2. The second interpretation of najash is a broader one, more than merely limiting it to\ntrading. Ibn Rajab says here it means any kind of deceiving actions that will lead to\nharming others. He adds that all dealings that are conducted in a deceiving way are\nincluded here. He quotes Surah Fatir, Ayah 43 : \"That the evil plot encompasses only\nhim who makes it.\"\nIbn Rajab says that this hadith is a warning to Muslims not to hate one another, especially if it is\nbecause of self-interest. Why? Because Muslims are brothers in Islam. They should love each\nother and should not hate one another. Consequently, al-nameemah, backbiting and slander are\nforbidden because they will lead to hatred among the Muslim community. Ibn Rajab says that\nwhen the Muslims started dividing into different sects because of conflicting views regarding\ncertain religious matters, this led to disputes and hatred among the community, and thus\ndisunity.\nWe should not turn our backs on one another. Ibn Rajab says this means any form of\ndisassociation. He says that the Prophet, sallallahu 'alayhi wasallam, said the Muslim is not allowed\nto disassociate himself from the others for more than three days. This is, as Ibn Rajab points\nout, in worldly matters. Whereas in the religious matters, disassociation is one of the\npunishments that Islam allows - e.g. to disassociate with those who commit sins in order to\nteach them a lesson. But scholars say that if the person who commits the sin is not likely to\ncome back to the right path, then it is meaningless to disassociate with him. As one of the",

There is obviously a difference between the two versions because 'to\nrelief' means to minimise the difficulty or distress, whereas 'to remove' means to totally eradicate\nthe difficulty or hardship.\nIbn Rajab says the one who successfully removes a grief or distress that a Muslim is\nencountering will be rewarded more than the one who helps and tries his best to minimise the\nconsequences of a certain difficulty.

Ibn Rajab emphasises that we have to motivate Muslims to help others and\nto remove the distress or difficulties of one another.\nThe Prophet, sallallahu 'alayhi wasallam, says that the reward for the removal or relief of the\ndistress of a Muslim will be rewarded by a removal of a similar distress or difficulty in the\nHereafter. Ibn Rajab questions the difference between the two situations where in the first one\nthe hadith mentioned only the relief or removal of the distressful aspect of the Hereafter and not\nin this world. He says that not everyone is subject to such distress in this world - this is\ncontrasted to ale'sar (unable to repay). He explains that since the difficulties of this life are\nincomparable to the distress aspects of the Hereafter (which nobody can endure as it is beyond\nhuman capacity), Allah reserves the reward for removing a distress of a distressful aspect of this\nlife until the Day of Judgment.\n\"Whosoever alleviates the difficulties of a needy person who cannot pay his debt, Allah\nwill alleviate his difficulties in both this world and the Hereafter.\"\nHere, it is not wise or appropriate for a Muslim to demand his money back from a poor or\nneedy Muslim who honestly cannot afford to pay him. He should either give him a chance until\nhe is able to repay his money or forgive him. The first choice is an obligation because Allah\ncommands us to do so in Surah al-Baqarah, Ayah 280. The second way of alleviation is that the\nperson who is owed the money might forgive the borrower and try to help him not just by\ngiving him more time but also by reducing the amount of money owed or forgiving him.\nThe Prophet, sallallahu 'alayhi wasallam, says in one of his great hadiths: \"A man of the previous\nnations was very rich and people used to borrow money from him. Not only did he lend them\nmoney, which is indeed a good deed, but he also asked his sons to alleviate and forgive those\nwho could not repay the money.\" The Prophet, sallallahu 'alayhi wasallam, says that in the\nHereafter Allah will reward him and forgive his sins because of his generosity. Allah says in\nSurah al-Furqan, Ayah 26 that \"it will be a very hard day for the disbelievers\". This means that\nthere is a situation where a person who is kind to those in need and Allah will relief that person\nby rewarding him a great reward from Allah's Mercy and Help.\n\"Whosoever conceals the faults of a Muslim, Allah will conceal his faults in this world\nand the Hereafter.\"\nIbn Rajab says that people can fall into two categories:\n1. Those who are not known for transgression or committing bad deeds. For these people,\nif by any chance they commit a mistake, it should not be revealed.

Allah will make it easy for the knowledge seeker so that he will benefit from the\nknowledge he is seeking. This means that he will benefit from the knowledge and this\nwill lead him to enter Paradise. There are many people who seek knowledge but there are\nno blessings in the knowledge they seek. The crucial point here is the person should seek\nknowledge with good intentions.\n3. For the one who seeks knowledge with good intentions, Allah will safely help him go\nthrough the horrible incidents and situations on the Day of Judgment.\nIbn Rajab classifies ilm (knowledge) into two types:\n1. The outcome of knowledge is placed in the heart. That is the knowledge about Allah and\nHis attributes that implies fearing Allah, glorifying Him, and loving Him.\n2. The knowledge that we merely memorise or speak about - without our hearts being\ninfluenced or affected. This means that if the person does not abide by the knowledge\nthat he has already obtained, then he is in a very critical situation where the he may be\nsubject to the punishment of Allah.\n\"No people gather together in one of the houses of Allah, reciting the Book of Allah and\nstudying it among themselves, except that tranquility descends upon them, mercy\ncovers them, the angels surround them, and Allah makes mention of them amongst\nthose who are in His presence.\"\nHere the hadith implies a preferable act: to go to the mosque, to recite and study the Qur'an, or\nattending lectures. Ibn Rajab says that this can be applied to all branches of knowledge and not\njust the Qur'an. The hadith mentions four rewards for those who gather in the mosque:\n1. Tranquility - this is a great reward which includes relief from stress and being calm.\n2. The Mercy of Allah over them.\n3. The angels surrounding them.\n4. Allah making mention of them amongst those who are in His presence.\n\"Whosoever is slowed down by his deeds will not be hastened forward by his lineage.\"\nThis indicates that doing deeds are the means of getting the rewards and that will lead a person\nto Paradise. Allah says: \"For all shall be judged against their actions\". If the good deeds are not\nenough, the person's lineage or ancestry will not benefit him. This is because Allah made\nrewards related to good deeds and not lineage.\nNo ties of kinship will prevail amongst them.",

Then the hadith states a\nmotivation factor: Whosoever is fulfilling the needs of his brother, Allah is fulfilling his needs.\nThis version is more than simply stating a principle - it can be taken as a motivation for helping\nother Muslims, especially those who are in need. We just need to imagine the situation of the\nummah when we help each other and fulfill the needs of others.

However, there are some exceptions because\nthe sin is sometimes considered greater due to certain reasons. One of these reasons is the\nhonour of time or place such as the four months (al-'ashhor al-hurum). This is the view of Ibn\nAbbas (the narrator of the hadith) and Qutadeh. For the month of Ramadhan there are two\nclaimed hadiths but which are considered not authentic according to Ibn Rajab who states that\nsins are considered greater during Ramadhan and during the Hajj (pilgrimage). This is stated in\nSurah al-Baqarah, Ayah 197.\nIn terms of place, for example Makkah, Allah says in Surah al-Hajj, Ayah 25:\nAnd whoever is inclined to evil action therein (in Makkah) or to do wrong, him\nwe shall cause to taste from a painful turmoil.\nBecause of this, a few of the companions of the Prophet, sallallahu 'alayhi wasallam, used to avoid\ndoing certain actions in Makkah.\nAnother criterion for considering sins as great is the nobility of the person who commits the sin.\nThis is because, as Ibn Rajab says, since he is a person of knowledge of Allah and His attributes,\nhis closeness to Allah should prevent him from committing sins. If he commits sins, his sins will\nbe considered greater than normal people.\nThe hadith mentioned four types of deeds:\n1. Doing good deeds - the result will be a multiplication of rewards.\n2. Doing evil acts - this will be recorded as one sin for one sin.\n3. The intention of doing good deeds - this will be recorded even if it is not done as one\ndeed. 'Intention' here means that we have a great eagerness and a very strong\ndetermination to do a certain deed - and not merely thoughts of doing it.\nSome examples of this type, as mentioned by Ibn Rajab, are:\n\nIf someone has intended to wake up in the middle of the night to perform\nthe night prayer but he did not do so because he overslept.\n\nIf someone intended to pray or fast.\n\nIf someone intended to do jihad or umra.",

Why? After all\nthis mercy and grace from Allah where Allah multiplies good deeds up to 700 times, after all the\nchances and opportunities that Allah gives us, if a person still persists on disobedience and\ncommits evil acts and in the end his bad deeds outweighs his good ones, then he is truly a big\nsinner and transgressor. He has no intention of doing good deeds. He has no one to blame but\nhimself.\nThere is a saying for Ibn Mas'oud: \"Woe to the one whose sins outweigh his good deeds\". The\nProphet, sallallahu 'alayhi wasallam, said to his Companions: \"Whom do you consider as a\nbankrupt?\" They said: \"The one who does not have a dinar or derham (money).\" The Prophet,\nsallallahu 'alayhi wasallam, said: \"The real bankrupt is the one who comes with mountains of good\ndeeds but he also comes with many bad deeds that are related to attacking and harming the\npeople.\" In this case, the bad deeds are not easily omitted because they are related to the rights\nof human beings. This person may wrong others by slander, backbiting, killing, etc. As a result,\nhis good deeds will be taken from him in the Hereafter as a matter of just. In addition to that,\nthe Prophet, sallallahu 'alayhi wasallam, says part of the bad deeds of the people whom he has\nwronged will be added to his record and the result would be that he will be thrown into the\nHellfire.\nWe need to imagine just how horrible the situation is. We need to reflect on this hadith and not\nto wrong, belittle or fail other Muslims or non-Muslims in the same way. We should also be kind\nto animals as the Prophet, sallallahu 'alayhi wasallam, said that a woman will enter Hellfire because\nof her mistreatment of a cat. The Prophet, sallallahu 'alayhi wasallam, also mentions about a\nwoman who is very pious and did good deeds but she annoyed and bothered her neighbours -\nshe too is in the Hellfire.\nMuslims need to be careful when it comes to dealing with other people. Unless we receive\nforgiveness from others, we will be held responsible for wrongdoings towards others. This has\nto do with our akhlaq and values as Muslims. We need to be concerned about this if we want to\nachieve any success in this life or the Hereafter.",

There are many verses in the Qur'an that talk\nabout the concept of wilayah. These verses talk about the qualities or attributes of awliya' and\ntheir status in the sight of Allah. In this hadith Allah mentions the status of the wali even before\nHe talks about His attributes. This status is mentioned in the beginning (i.e. Allah will declare\nwar against whoever acts with enmity towards one of His closer servants) and in the end (i.e.\nAllah will answer their du'a and will give them refuge). This shows the status of awliya' in the\nsight of Allah. In the middle of the hadith, Allah tells us the qualities of His closer servants.\nThe hadith also tells us that Allah loves those who are the closer servants to Allah. This is a\nnatural result of what they do. Allah tells us about their actions upon which they deserved to be\nloved by Allah. We will see that there are two levels of servants of Allah: The first level is those\nwho fulfill the obligations and avoid the prohibitions (muharramat). The second level is those\nwho not only do this but also perform the preferable acts (nawafil).\nThe concept of wilayah (awliya' Allah) is based on the verses of the Qur'an and this hadith. In the\nQur'an there are three verses in Surah Yunus - Ayah 62, 63 and 64.\nNo doubt verily the awliya' of Allah (the closer servants of Allah) no fear shall\ncome upon them nor shall they grieve. Those who believed and used to fear\nAllah much, for them are the glad tidings in this life and the Hereafter.\nBased on these three verses and this Hadith Qudsi, we can say that the concept of wilayah\ncomprises of the following:\n1. The love of Allah\n2. Fearing of Allah\n3. Belief or faith in Allah and his Messengers\n4. Devotion, honesty, and sincerity\n5. Obedience to Allah and following His instructions - this include performing good deeds.\nThis motif of this obedience is based on fear of Allah, repenting to Allah and submission\nto His will.\nThe origin of wilayah is closeness to Allah and the enmity is being far away from the path of\nAllah. Based on this, the awliya' of Allah are those who are obedient and perform the good deeds\nwhich make them closer to Allah. The enemies of Allah, on the other hand, are those who are\nevil doers. Their ill deeds distance themselves away from Allah and this will make them far from\nAllah's blessing, support, and love.",

    "text": "- 198 -\nLessons\nIn the first portion of the hadith (\"Nothing endears My servant to Me than doing of what I have\nmade obligatory upon him to do. And My servant continues to draw nearer to Me with\nsupererogatory (nawafil) prayers so that I shall love him.\"), Allah classifies His servants into two\ncategories:\n1. The first category are those who get closer to Allah by fulfilling the obligations and\navoiding the prohibitions. This is a moderate level that has been described in the Qur'an\nas ashab alyameen. This is the minimum level of wilayah. In other words, wilayah is achieved\njust by fulfilling the obligations and avoiding the prohibitions. This level of wilayah is\nexpected from all believers.\n2. The second category of people are those who are closer to Allah by being competent (alsabiqeen) in their worship and effort and strive to be close to Allah. This category of\npeople are not satisfied only of performing the obligations and avoiding the prohibitions\nbut they go further by performing the preferable acts. They also avoid the non-preferable\nacts. Consequently, they will reach the degree of wara' and wilayah that will make Allah\nlove them. Allah mentions this explicitly and that His love will be granted for these\ncompetent people.\nSome of the early people (salaf) used to say that it is not a big matter whether you love; the\nbiggest matter is to be loved by Allah. If you are loved by Allah, then you are granted with His\nmercy and blessings. You are going to be granted with His support and guidance.\nThe Prophet, sallallahu 'alayhi wasallam, used to say the following in his du'a: \"O Allah I ask You\nthat You love me and the love of those who love You and to enable me also to love every act\nand deed that may bring me closer to You\". That is the reason why some of the early scholars\nsay that the actions and the worship that are based on the love of Allah will continue and never\nbe depressed or frustrated. Some others say that the one who loves Allah will not get fed up or\nbored of getting closer to Allah. He never feels that he is bored of doing good deeds and acts\nthat will get him closer to Allah. Other scholars say that for the one who loves Allah, his heart is\npurified and he always remembers Allah. He always seeks and strives to do good deeds and acts\nthat will get him closer to Allah. He does all of this with pleasure.\nThe early scholars also say that the one who loves Allah should obey Him, otherwise he is only\nclaiming to love Allah. Scholars say that among the preferable acts (nawafil) that make a person\nbecome closer to Allah, is the nawafil al-salawat (the preferable prayers that the Prophet, sallallahu\n'alayhi wasallam, used to pray every day). Another thing is the recitation of the Qur'an and\nlistening to it with full attention and understanding. Also part of the preferable acts is the\nremembrance of Allah where what the tongue says matches with what the heart believes, and the\nlove of other good Muslims who are closer to Allah.",

This will be strengthened by performing the preferable acts until the\nheart is full of these acts where nothing else will enslave or capture the heart. The heart is fully\ndevoted to Allah. When that status is reached by the believer, the limbs of that servant will act\nonly in accordance to what Allah loves. Then he will be seeing, hearing, and doing what Allah\nsees, hears and does. He will be walking towards what Allah wants and likes. The early salaf say\nthat he cannot even commit a sin. Ibn Rajab quotes Ali who said that they used to believe that\nOmar's Satan was so frustrated to do any sin or disobedience. This is one of the secrets or the\nreal fruits of tawhid. This is because \"La ilaha illa Allah\" means that we should only worship,\nglorify, obey, and love Allah and fear Him the most. When this realisation of tawhid is achieved,\nthen he says the heart will have no place for anything that may displease Allah. What will be in\nthe heart is only what Allah loves. In this case, that person will never commit a sin or any kind\nof disobedience. Committing sins takes place only if the person loves what Allah hates or that\nperson hates what Allah loves. It also takes place when self interest is given a priority and\ndominance over the love of Allah. The result will be that the obligations of the tawhid will not be\ncomplete. The person will be led to delay obligations or to commit sins.\nThe third portion of this hadith (\"And if he asks (something) of Me, I shall surely give it to him,\nand if he takes refuge in Me, I shall certainly grant him it.\") Implies that the closer servant of\nAllah has a special status in the sight of Allah. This special status will lead to that whatever he\nasks of Allah, Allah will give him and his du'a will be attended to. If he seeks refuge from\nanything, he will be given that.\nIn Sunan Al-Imam Al-Nisa'ei, there is one chapter on iste'azeh. There are many hadiths in this\nchapter that tell us the sayings that the Prophet, sallallahu 'alayhi wasallam, used to say to seek\nrefuge of Allah to be saved from things such as poverty, ignorance, the turmoil of the grave,\nsadness and depression of this life, and various diseases. The closer servant of Allah is granted to\nbe saved from the above mentioned things and many others. As Muslims we have to realise the\nimportance of this portion of the hadith especially for those who are hearing the hadith for the\nfirst time.

This means that a person might be forgiven but he still has to take\nresponsibility for his actions. The consequent rulings for doing something mistakenly or out of\nforgiveness can be classified into three categories:\n1. There are mistakes where there is no consequent ruling such as a person or a Muslim\nwho eats during the day in the month of Ramadhan out of forgetfulness. The majority of\nscholars say that his fasting is still valid and he does not have to repeat that day. This\nopinion is based on the hadith that is related by Imam Al-Bukhari and Imam Muslim\nwhich states that \"any Muslim who eats during Ramadhan out of forgetfulness will be\nexcused and forgiven.\"\n2. There are consequent rulings to actions that are done out of mistakes or forgetfulness\nsuch as if someone kills a Muslim by mistake - as what happens nowadays in car\naccidents or accidents at work, etc. It is well-known by scholars that for such a person\nthere is no consequent ruling. There is no kaffarah (expiation of sins) but he has to pay\nthe fidyah as stated in the Qur'an. Another example is if someone caused harm or damage\nto the property or money of someone else by mistake. In this case the person is\nresponsible and has to compensate for what he has damaged even though he is forgiven\nby Allah and is not being regarded as sinful.\n3. There are actions where there are different opinions among the Muslim scholars of\nwhether there is a consequent ruling or not. Some scholars say that the person has a\nconsequent ruling. Others will say that he is fully excused and has nothing to do. For\nexample, if a person talked out of forgetfulness during his prayer. Does he have to repeat\nhis prayer? Here we have different opinions among the scholars. Some will say he has to\nrepeat while others will say he is going to be forgiven and excused.\nAnother example is that a person takes an oath or swears by Allah not to do something\nand then he does it out of mistake or because of forgetfulness. Is this person\nresponsible? Some scholars will say he is not forgiven and he has to make kaffarah.\nOthers will say that he is forgiven and need not make kaffarah. A third example is if a\nperson who is muhrim - that is he intended to perform 'umrah or hajj and then by mistake\nhe hunts or kills an animal. Is he forgiven (i.e. is this not considered a sinful act)? He is\nforgiven and will not be punished for that. But the issue is whether he has to pay for it\nand be responsible or not. This is again a debatable issue among the scholars. Ibn Rajab\nstates that the person who acts out of forgetfulness or by mistake is excused and that the\nsinfulness will be removed because sinfulness is related to those who does it deliberately.\nBut the ruling, whatever the responsibility is, is not meant by this hadith. The hadith does\nnot mean that they are going to be excused from everything including any kind of\nresponsibility or rulings. This is something very important to know because some\nMuslims have the misconception that they are totally excused and they do not have to\nbear any consequences.",

The person is powerless and has no choice to refuse doing an evil act or something\nwhich is not acceptable by shari'ah. Ibn Rajab says that he is excused.\n2. The person is forced to harm someone else. In this situation, we look at the issue from\nthe perspective that he has the power over his actions and can refuse to do the harm but\nat the same time his intention is to remove the harm from himself rather than to harm\nthe other person. What is the ruling in this case? The scholars say that there are certain\ncases where the Muslim should not do it (i.e. harm someone else) even if he is harmed\nhimself, such as if a Muslim is forced to kill someone else. He is not allowed to do so\nbecause this is a major harm that Muslims should do their best to avoid.\nBut the scholars have different views regarding similar situations and actions. The\nfirst situation is that if a Muslim took an oath not to do something and then he is\nforced to do it. Some say that he is excused and he is allowed to do the thing that\nhe promised not to do - he is excused and there is no ruling here. Other scholars\nsay he is responsible and he should not do it. If it is out of his choice, this goes\nunder the first category. The same if someone is forced or threaten or even\nbeaten and he has been ordered to cause damage to the property of someone\nelse. Scholars say since he has the choice, he has to do his best not to cause the\ndamage. The issue here is that if he does it, scholars say that he will be excused in\nthe sense that he is not sinful but he still remains responsible for the damage that\nhe caused.\nThe second situation where Muslim scholars differ is prohibited acts such as\ndrinking wine. Some scholars say if a person is forced, then he is excused. Other\nscholars say though he is forced, he is not allowed to do it.\nAnother view or category is the distinction between speech and actions. In terms\nof speech, a person might be forced and allowed to say something that is not\nallowable. The scholars say he should not practice taqiyah. Taqiyah means to say or\ndo something which you do not believe in and are not satisfied with. This only\napplies to sayings and not actions. Regarding this issue there is an agreement\namong the Muslim scholars. They say that whoever is forced to say something\nthat is not allowed in shari'ah, then he will be allowed to say it - he will not be\nregarded or considered as 'saying' it. There is another condition that the scholars\nset. They say that whenever a person is put into ikrah or duress, the duress should\nbe definite and most likely to happen and not just something the person imagines\nor assumes. He has to be sure.\nWhat is mentioned in this hadith should not be abused. Some Muslims today abuse what the\nhadith implies by using it as an excuse to not uphold a responsibility or to break a promise. Allah",

The Prophet, sallallahu 'alayhi wasallam, used the analogy\n'to be as a stranger' because, as Ibn Rajab points out, the stranger is usually prepared to\neventually go back to his original place or home town. His heart will always long for his\nhome. His main concern will be to be in preparation to do whatever possible and\nbeneficial for returning. A stranger does not look like the other people in his current\nenvironment - he is different.

As believers, we should be different from the 'people of this\nworld'.\nIbn Al-Qayyim, a famous Muslim scholar, says that a Muslim is a stranger amongst the\ndisbelievers and the Mu'min is a stranger amongst the Muslims, and the Muhsin is a\nstranger amongst the Mu'mins. This means that there are different levels of being a\nstranger: the lowest level is Islam, the second level is Iman and the third level is Ihsan.\n[Refer to Hadith 2]\n2. To be a traveler or wayfarer, traveling along a path\nThis is a higher level than the stranger. The traveler is always traveling day and night\nwithout stopping, He is heeding towards his final destination. Even if he stops for a\nwhile, this is to provide himself with the needed power to continue his journey and to go\nfarther until he achieves his main objective. A stranger might obtain and keep more\nthings than he actually needs but the traveler takes as little as possible in terms of luggage\nor other things. Similarly, the believer who is in such a situation has a main objective or\nconcern - and that is not to take more than what he needs (i.e. he should not be weighed\ndown with materialistic things or wealth).",

Rapid life changes due to technology advancement and progress which in turn creates\nother problems, such as:\n\nAdjustment between the old lifestyle and the new lifestyle.\n\nThe emergence of new values which lead to conflicts between sets of\nvalues.\n\nTechnology misuse.\n\nThe increase of social ills.\n\nThe weak religious awareness and education or spiritual training in the\nIslamic world (i.e. tazkiyyah).\n4. The challenges of modernity.\n5. The challenges of globalisation and promotion of imposed corrupted western values.\nConclusion\nThese challenges add to the size of the responsibilities that face the Muslims who want to\nimplement this hadith in their lives. Most of these challenges are addressed in previous hadiths.\nThis hadith contains a helpful piece of advice for every single Muslim which helps us to deal with\nthis life in a proper way by offering us two choices or levels. We need to understand all the\nabove mentioned issues. This will help us to apply the hadith in a more positive way.\nSome Muslims throughout history misunderstood this hadith. Consequently, they misunderstood\nthe Islamic teachings regarding dealing with life. They understood it in a negative way. We also\nfind other Muslims who are affected by the challenges of modernity and the excessive tension\nthat is given to this life. We find minimum levels of good deeds. They are overwhelmed by the\nadvancement of technology and end up with little iman or spirituality.

If that level leads him to avoid what needs\nto be avoided, then that is an additional level that Allah will reward him for.\nIn the two Sahihs of Al-Bukhari and Muslim it is related that the Prophet, sallallahu 'alayhi\nwasallam, said: \"None of you will be truly a believer until I become more beloved to him than\nhimself, his children, his family, and all the people.\" The true love necessitates that one has to\nfollow whatever has been commanded by Allah and the Prophet, sallallahu 'alayhi wasallam, as\nstated in Surah al-Imran Ayah 31-32:\nSay (O Muhammad sallallahu 'alayhi wasallam): \"If you (really) love Allah then\nfollow me, Allah will love you and forgive your sins.

    "text": "- 214 -\nConclusion\nThough this hadith is considered a weak hadith, it states a very important meaning: in order to\nfulfill one's faith, one has to make a continuous effort to control his or her self-desires and to\nlike what Allah and the Prophet, sallallahu 'alayhi wasallam, like, and to dislike what Allah and the\nProphet, sallallahu 'alayhi wasallam, dislikes. This is actually a very important task which we are\nrequired to do in order to adhere to the path of Allah. The result will be attaining Allah's\npleasure and being honoured in this life and the Hereafter by being a truly honest, sincere\nservant of Allah.\nMuslims must be sincere in their efforts to fight self-desires. The issue is not to like or dislike\nbut what the result of this likes or dislikes is. For instance, if someone is sleeping before dawn in\nthe early morning and then he hears the call for Fajr prayer but is too lazy or sleepy to wake up\nto perform the salah, this is considered following his self-desires.

Allah says in Surah Ghafir Ayah\n60:\nAnd your Lord said: Call upon me, I will respond to you.\nThe Prophet, sallallahu 'alayhi wasallam, said: \"Supplication is the essence of worship\" [AlTirmidhi]. The Prophet, sallallahu 'alayhi wasallam, also said: \"Supplicate to Allah as if you\nare certain about His response.\" Supplication is guaranteed that Allah will attend to or\nrespond to it when certain conditions are fulfilled. At the same time there are other\nthings that a Muslim should avoid doing in order for his supplication to be answered.\nThe conditions of supplication have been discussed in previous hadiths. The most\nimportant thing is the full concentration and attention of the heart and to have full hope\nthat Allah will respond to that du'a and not to rush it.\nMuslims have to practice supplication frequently because it is a continuous process.\nAmong the things that a Muslim asks Allah in his supplication are to forgive his sins, to\nbe saved from the Hell-Fire and to be among those who enter Paradise. Muslims have to\nmake du'a with full hope that there is a response. Allah says in a Hadith Qudsi: \"I am as\nMy servant expects of Me.\" [Muslim]. The Prophet, sallallahu 'alayhi wasallam, says in\nanother hadith: \"No Muslim who supplicates a supplication, that does not contain any sin\nor cutting of relations, Allah will grant him one of three things: either Allah will\nimmediately respond to his supplication, or He may keep or store the answer for the\nHereafter, or He will turn away from him an equivalent amount of evil or harm.\" The\nCompanions asked what if they keep requesting Allah. The Prophet, sallallahu 'alayhi\nwasallam, replied: \"Then Allah shall give you even both.\" [Imam Ahmad].\n2. The second means that leads us to receive Allah's forgiveness is istighfar (seeking\nforgiveness), even if someone has committed many sins. What is meant by seeking\nforgiveness is the istighfar that is linked to repentance which in turn also necessitates that\nthe Muslim gives up committing sins and does not persist on doing them. Istighfar is a\nform of worship. The Muslim has to do and perform a lot of istighfar every day. Allah\ncommanded us to make istighfar and praised those who perform istighfar. Allah says in\nSurah al-Zumar Ayah 53:\nO My servants, who have transgressed against themselves! Despair not of\nthe Mercy of Allah. Verily, Allah forgives all sins.

    "text": "- 217 -\nThere are many forms of istighfar. There is what the Prophet, sallallahu 'alayhi wasallam,\ntaught his Companions to say. It is also narrated that the Prophet, sallallahu 'alayhi\nwasallam, used to seek forgiveness from Allah more than seventy times a day, and in some\nnarration more than one hundred times a day. Consequently, Muslims are recommended\nand required to do istighfar and seek the forgiveness of Allah at least one hundred times a\nday. The best statement of forgiveness is the statement that is narrated by the Prophet,\nsallallahu 'alayhi wasallam, when he said: \"O Allah: You are my Lord. There is no God but\nYou. You created me and I am Your servant. I am following Your covenant and promise\nto the best of my ability. I seek refuge in You from the evils that I have done. I profess\nto You Your bounties upon me and I confess my sins. Forgive me for no one forgives\nsins except You.\" The Prophet, sallallahu 'alayhi wasallam, says: \"Whoever says this\nstatement with certainty concerning it in the daytime and dies that day before the\nevening, he is one of the inhabitants of Paradise; and whoever says this statement with\ncertainty concerning it during the night and dies that night before the morning, he is one\nof the inhabitants of Paradise.\" [Al-Bukhari]\nIstighfar is recommended to be practiced by true and close servants of Allah and every\nMuslim. They are recommended to do so in the morning, preferably after the Fajr\nprayers, and in the evening until the sunset. This should be part of the supplications that\nthey perform day and night. Allah says in Surah al-Nisa' Ayah 110:\nAnd whoever does evil or wrongs himself but afterwards seeks Allah's\nForgiveness, he will find Allah Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.\n3. The third cause or means of seeking Allah's forgiveness is Tawhid. Tawhid means that a\nMuslim should worship Allah alone. Allah should be worshiped without associating or\nascribing any partners with Him. Allah says in Surah al-Nisa' Ayah 116:\nVerily! Allah forgives not the setting up partners (in worship) with Him,\nbut He forgives whom He wills sins other than that, and whoever sets up\npartners in worship with Allah has indeed strayed far away.\nTawhid, as the scholars say, melts away sins.

It is also narrated that the Prophet, sallallahu 'alayhi\nwasallam, used to seek forgiveness from Allah more than seventy times a day, and in some\nnarration more than one hundred times a day. Consequently, Muslims are recommended\nand required to do istighfar and seek the forgiveness of Allah at least one hundred times a\nday. The best statement of forgiveness is the statement that is narrated by the Prophet,\nsallallahu 'alayhi wasallam, when he said: \"O Allah: You are my Lord. There is no God but\nYou. You created me and I am Your servant. I am following Your covenant and promise\nto the best of my ability. I seek refuge in You from the evils that I have done. I profess\nto You Your bounties upon me and I confess my sins. Forgive me for no one forgives\nsins except You.\" The Prophet, sallallahu 'alayhi wasallam, says: \"Whoever says this\nstatement with certainty concerning it in the daytime and dies that day before the\nevening, he is one of the inhabitants of Paradise; and whoever says this statement with\ncertainty concerning it during the night and dies that night before the morning, he is one\nof the inhabitants of Paradise.\" [Al-Bukhari]",
